.UNINDENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Synchronizes a filesystem directory with objects in a bucket. Traverses sub\-directories copying new and modified files or objects from the source to the destination and optionally deleting those that are not present in the source.

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-bn, \-\-bucket\-name [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The name of the bucket.
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-control [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The optional Cache\-Control header that defines the caching behavior value to be returned in GetObject and HeadObject responses. Specifying values for this header has no effect on Object Storage behavior. Programs that read the object determine what to do based on the value provided. For example, you could use this header to identify objects that require caching restrictions.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-content\-disposition [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The optional Content\-Disposition header that defines presentational information for the object to be returned in GetObject and HeadObject responses. Specifying values for this header has no effect on Object Storage behavior. Programs that read the object determine what to do based on the value provided. For example, you could use this header to let users download objects with custom filenames in a browser.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-content\-encoding [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The optional Content\-Encoding header that defines the content encoding of the object to be returned in GetObject and HeadObject responses. Specifying values for this header has no effect on Object Storage behavior. Programs that read the object determine what to do based on the value provided. For example, you could use this header to determine what decoding mechanisms need to be applied to obtain the media\-type specified by the Content\-Type header of the object.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-content\-language [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The optional Content\-Language header that defines the content language of the object to be returned in GetObject and HeadObject responses. Specifying values for this header has no effect on Object Storage behavior. Programs that read the object determine what to do based on the value provided. For example, you could use this header to identify and differentiate objects based on a particular language.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-content\-type [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The optional Content\-Type header that defines the standard MIME type format of the object to be returned in GetObject and HeadObject responses. Content type defaults to ‘application/octet\-stream’ if not specified. Specifying values for this header has no effect on Object Storage behavior. Programs that read the object determine what to do based on the value provided. For example, you could use this header to identify and perform special operations on text only objects.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-delete
.UNINDENT
.sp
delete files/objects that exist in the destination but not in the source. No files or objects are deleted by default.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-dest\-dir [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Required when not specifying –src\-dir. The directory into which objects in a bucket will be synced as files. This directory will be created if it does not exist. An object will require downloading if it does not exist in the local directory or if it exists, either the size of the object differs from the size of the local file or the last modified time of the object is newer than the last modified time of the local file. Objects in Archive tier which have not been restored will not be downloaded.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-dry\-run
.UNINDENT
.sp
Prints the list of files that would be uploaded, downloaded or deleted without actually performing any actions.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-encryption\-key\-file [filename]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A file containing the base64\-encoded string of the AES\-256 encryption key associated with the object.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-exclude [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Only process files which do not match the specified pattern. Patterns are applied relative to the current directory. This option can be specified multiple times to match on multiple patterns. Supported pattern symbols are:

.sp
*: Matches everything
.sp
?: Matches any single character
.sp
[sequence]: Matches any character in sequence
.sp
[!sequence]: Matches any character not in sequence
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id –> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with advanced JSON options” link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-metadata [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Arbitrary string keys and values for user\-defined metadata. This will be applied to all files being uploaded. Must be in JSON format. Example: ‘{“key1”:”value1”,”key2”:”value2”}’
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-ns, \-\-namespace, \-\-namespace\-name [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The top\-level namespace used for the request. If not provided, this parameter will be obtained internally using a call to ‘oci os ns get’
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-follow\-symlinks
.UNINDENT
.sp
Symbolic links will be ignored while traversing the local filesystem.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-multipart
.UNINDENT
.sp
Do not transfer the file in multiple parts. By default, files above 128 MiB will be transferred in multiple parts, then combined.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-parallel\-operations\-count [integer range]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The number of parallel operations to perform. Decreasing this value will make the process less resource intensive but it may take longer. Increasing this value may decrease the time taken, but the process will consume more system resources and network bandwidth. The maximum is 1000. [default: 10]
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-part\-size [integer range]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Part size (in MiB) to use when downloading an object in multiple parts. The minimum allowable size is 128 MiB.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-prefix [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
When specified with –src\-dir, the files are uploaded as objects with the specified prefix. When specified with –dest\-dir, only objects with the specified prefix are downloaded but the prefix is not added to the file names.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-src\-dir [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Required when not specifying –dest\-dir. The directory from which the files will be synced to a bucket as objects. A local file will require uploading if the size of the local file is different than the size of the object, the last modified time of the local file is newer than the last modified time of the object, or the local file does not exist under the specified bucket and prefix.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-storage\-tier [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The storage tier that the objects should be stored in. If not specified, the objects will be stored in the same storage tier as the bucket.

.SH EXAMPLE USING REQUIRED PARAMETER
.sp
Copy the following CLI commands into a file named example.sh. Run the command by typing “bash example.sh” and replacing the example parameters with your own.
.sp
Please note this sample will only work in the POSIX\-compliant bash\-like shell. You need to set up \fI\%the OCI configuration\fP <\fBhttps://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm#configfile\fP> and \fI\%appropriate security policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP> before trying the examples.

This command will sync the current directory to a bucket in object storage. Any file will be uploaded if an object by that name does not exist under the specified bucket or if it exists, either the size of the file differs from the size of the object or the last modified time of the file is newer than the last modified time of the object. No object will be deleted from the bucket.
