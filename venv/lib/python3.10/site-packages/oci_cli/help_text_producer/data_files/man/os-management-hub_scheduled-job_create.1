.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id –> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-locations [complex type]

To apply the job to all compartments in the tenancy, set this to the tenancy OCID (root compartment) and set isSubcompartmentIncluded to true.

The frequency schedule for a recurring scheduled job.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-retry\-intervals [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The amount of time in minutes to wait until retrying the scheduled job. If set, the service will automatically retry a failed scheduled job after the interval. For example, you could set the interval to [2,5,10]. If the initial execution of the job fails, the service waits 2 minutes and then retries. If that fails, the service waits 5 minutes and then retries. If that fails, the service waits 10 minutes and then retries.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using

.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
