.B \-\-allowed\-operations [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
OPTIONAL. Required only when this App acts as an OAuthClient. Supported values are ‘introspect’ and ‘onBehalfOfUser’. The value ‘introspect’ allows the client to look inside the access\-token. The value ‘onBehalfOfUser’ overrides how the client’s privileges are combined with the privileges of the Subject User. Ordinarily, authorization calculates the set of effective privileges as the intersection of the client’s privileges and the user’s privileges. The value ‘onBehalfOf’ indicates that authorization should ignore the privileges of the client and use only the user’s privileges to calculate the effective privileges.

OPTIONAL. Required only when this App acts as an OAuthClient. Supported values are ‘introspect’ and ‘onBehalfOfUser’. The value ‘introspect’ allows the client to look inside the access\-token. The value ‘onBehalfOfUser’ overrides how the client’s privileges are combined with the privileges of the Subject User. Ordinarily, authorization calculates the set of effective privileges as the intersection of the client’s privileges and the user’s privileges. The value ‘onBehalfOf’ indicates that authorization should ignore the privileges of the client and use only the user’s privileges to calculate the effective privileges.

The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id –> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
