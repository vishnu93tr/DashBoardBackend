.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCID of the compartment where you want to create the secret.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-key\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCID of the master encryption key that is used to encrypt the secret. You must specify a symmetric key to encrypt the secret during import to the vault. You cannot encrypt secrets with asymmetric keys. Furthermore, the key must exist in the vault that you specify.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-secret\-name [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A user\-friendly name for the secret. Secret names should be unique within a vault. Avoid entering confidential information. Valid characters are uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, and periods.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-vault\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCID of the vault where you want to create the secret.
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{“Operations”: {“CostCenter”: “42”}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-description [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A brief description of the secret. Avoid entering confidential information.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-enable\-auto\-generation [boolean]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The value of this flag determines whether or not secret content will be generated automatically. If not set, it defaults to false.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{“Department”: “Finance”}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.

The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id –> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with advanced JSON options” link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-metadata [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Additional metadata that you can use to provide context about how to use the secret during rotation or other administrative tasks. For example, for a secret that you use to connect to a database, the additional metadata might specify the connection endpoint and the connection string. Provide additional metadata as key\-value pairs.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.

The base64\-encoded content of the secret.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-secret\-content\-name [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Names should be unique within a secret. Valid characters are uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, and periods.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-secret\-content\-stage [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The rotation state of the secret content. The default is \fICURRENT\fP, meaning that the secret is currently in use. A secret version that you mark as \fIPENDING\fP is staged and available for use, but you don’t yet want to rotate it into current, active use. For example, you might create or update a secret and mark its rotation state as \fIPENDING\fP if you haven’t yet updated the secret on the target system. When creating a secret, only the value \fICURRENT\fP is applicable, although the value \fILATEST\fP is also automatically applied. When updating a secret, you can specify a version’s rotation state as either \fICURRENT\fP or \fIPENDING\fP\&.

.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
