.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new instance in the specified compartment and the specified availability domain. For general information about instances, see \fI\%Overview of the Compute Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Concepts/computeoverview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about access control and compartments, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about availability domains, see \fI\%Regions and Availability Domains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm\fP>\&. To get a list of availability domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including instances, get an Oracle\-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource’s OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.
.sp
To launch an instance using an image or a boot volume use the \fIsourceDetails\fP parameter in \fI\%LaunchInstanceDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/LaunchInstanceDetails\fP>\&.
.sp
When you launch an instance, it is automatically attached to a virtual network interface card (VNIC), called the \fIprimary VNIC\fP\&. The VNIC has a private IP address from the subnet’s CIDR. You can either assign a private IP address of your choice or let Oracle automatically assign one. You can choose whether the instance has a public IP address. To retrieve the addresses, use the \fI\%ListVnicAttachments\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/vnic-attachment/list.html\fP> operation to get the VNIC ID for the instance, and then call \fI\%GetVnic\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/network/vnic/get.html\fP> with the VNIC ID.
.sp
You can later add secondary VNICs to an instance. For more information, see \fI\%Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To launch an instance from a Marketplace image listing, you must provide the image ID of the listing resource version that you want, but you also must subscribe to the listing before you try to launch the instance. To subscribe to the listing, use the \fI\%GetAppCatalogListingAgreements\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/pic/agreements/get.html\fP> operation to get the signature for the terms of use agreement for the desired listing resource version. Then, call \fI\%CreateAppCatalogSubscription\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/pic/subscription/create.html\fP> with the signature. To get the image ID for the LaunchInstance operation, call \fI\%GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/pic/version/get.html\fP>\&.
.sp
When launching an instance, you may provide the \fIsecurityAttributes\fP parameter in \fI\%LaunchInstanceDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/LaunchInstanceDetails\fP> to manage security attributes via the instance, or in the embedded \fI\%CreateVnicDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/CreateVnicDetails/\fP> to manage security attributes via the VNIC directly, but not both.  Providing \fIsecurityAttributes\fP in both locations will return a 400 Bad Request response.
.sp
To determine whether capacity is available for a specific shape before you create an instance, use the \fI\%CreateComputeCapacityReport\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/compute-capacity-report/create.html\fP> operation.

.B \-\-ipxe\-script\-file [filename]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is an advanced option.
.sp
When a bare metal or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE firmware that runs on the instance is configured to run an iPXE script to continue the boot process.
.sp
If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots. Be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots, not only after the initial LaunchInstance call.
.sp
The default iPXE script connects to the instance’s local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network\-boot from the instance’s local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015\-02.oracle.boot.
.sp
If your instance boot volume attachment type is paravirtualized, the boot volume is attached to the instance through virtio\-scsi and no iPXE script is used. If your instance boot volume attachment type is paravirtualized and you use custom iPXE to network boot into your instance, the primary boot volume is attached as a data volume through virtio\-scsi drive.

.B \-\-shape [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The shape of an instance. The shape determines the number of CPUs, amount of memory, and other resources allocated to the instance.
.sp
You can enumerate all available shapes by calling \fI\%ListShapes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/shape/list.html\fP>\&.

.B \-\-shape\-config [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.

.B \-\-source\-boot\-volume\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCID of the boot volume used to boot the instance. This is a shortcut for specifying a boot volume source via the –source\-details complex JSON parameter. If this parameter is provided, you cannot provide the –source\-details or –image\-id parameters.

.B \-\-ssh\-authorized\-keys\-file [filename]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A file containing one or more public SSH keys to be included in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file for the default user on the instance. Use a newline character to separate multiple keys. The SSH keys must be in the format necessary for the authorized_keys file. This parameter is a convenience wrapper around the ‘ssh_authorized_keys’ field of the –metadata parameter. Populating both values in the same call will result in an error. For more info see documentation: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/requests/LaunchInstanceDetails\fP\&.

.B \-\-user\-data\-file [filename]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A file containing data that Cloud\-Init can use to run custom scripts or provide custom Cloud\-Init configuration. This parameter is a convenience wrapper around the ‘user_data’ field of the –metadata parameter.  Populating both values in the same call will result in an error. For more info see Cloud\-Init documentation: \fI\%https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/format.html\fP\&.

.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
