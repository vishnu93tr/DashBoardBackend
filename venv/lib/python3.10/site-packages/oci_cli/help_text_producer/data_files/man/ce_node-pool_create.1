.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
