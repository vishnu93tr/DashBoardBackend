.sp
The “user_data” field and the “ssh_authorized_keys” field cannot be changed after an instance has launched. Any request that updates, removes, or adds either of these fields will be rejected.

.B \-\-fault\-domain [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Each availability domain contains three fault domains. Fault domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or Compute hardware maintenance that affects one fault domain does not affect instances in other fault domains.
.sp
To get a list of fault domains, use the \fI\%ListFaultDomains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/iam/fault-domain/list.html\fP> operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.

.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id –> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.

.UNINDENT
.sp
Whether symmetric multithreading is enabled on the instance. Symmetric multithreading is also called simultaneous multithreading (SMT) or Intel Hyper\-Threading.
.sp
Intel and AMD processors have two hardware execution threads per core (OCPU). SMT permits multiple independent threads of execution, to better use the resources and increase the efficiency of the CPU. When multithreading is disabled, only one thread is permitted to run on each core, which can provide higher or more predictable performance for some workloads.

.B \-\-shape [text]

The shape of the instance. The shape determines the number of CPUs and the amount of memory allocated to the instance.

.sp
For details about the CPUs, memory, and other properties of each shape, see \fI\%Compute Shapes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
The new shape must be compatible with the image that was used to launch the instance. You can enumerate all available shapes and determine image compatibility by calling \fI\%ListShapes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/shape/list.html\fP>\&.
.sp
To determine whether capacity is available for a specific shape before you change the shape of an instance, use the \fI\%CreateComputeCapacityReport\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/compute-capacity-report/create.html\fP> operation.

.sp
For a VM instance, resets the scheduled time that the instance will be reboot migrated for infrastructure maintenance, in the format defined by \fI\%RFC3339\fP <\fBhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339\fP>\&. If the instance hasn’t been rebooted after this date, Oracle reboots the instance within 24 hours of the time and date that maintenance is due.
.sp
To get the maximum possible date that a maintenance reboot can be extended, use \fI\%GetInstanceMaintenanceReboot\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/instance-maintenance-reboot/get.html\fP>\&.
.sp
Regardless of how the instance is stopped, this flag is reset to empty as soon as the instance reaches the Stopped state.
.sp
To reboot migrate a bare metal instance, use the \fI\%InstanceAction\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/instance/action.html\fP> operation.
