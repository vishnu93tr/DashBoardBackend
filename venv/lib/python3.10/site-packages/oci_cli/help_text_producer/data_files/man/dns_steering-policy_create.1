.sp

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCID of the compartment containing the steering policy.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-display\-name [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A user\-friendly name for the steering policy. Does not have to be unique and can be changed. Avoid entering confidential information.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-template [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A set of predefined rules based on the desired purpose of the steering policy. Each template utilizes Traffic Management’s rules in a different order to produce the desired results when answering DNS queries.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBExample:\fP The \fIFAILOVER\fP template determines answers by filtering the policy’s answers using the \fIFILTER\fP rule first, then the following rules in succession: \fIHEALTH\fP, \fIPRIORITY\fP, and \fILIMIT\fP\&. This gives the domain dynamic failover capability.
.sp
It is \fBstrongly recommended\fP to use a template other than \fICUSTOM\fP when creating a steering policy.
.sp
All templates require the rule order to begin with an unconditional \fIFILTER\fP rule that keeps answers contingent upon \fIanswer.isDisabled != true\fP, except for \fICUSTOM\fP\&. A defined \fIHEALTH\fP rule must follow the \fIFILTER\fP rule if the policy references a \fIhealthCheckMonitorId\fP\&. The last rule of a template must must be a \fILIMIT\fP rule. For more information about templates and code examples, see \fI\%Traffic Management API Guide\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/TrafficManagement/Concepts/trafficmanagementapi.htm\fP>\&.

\fBTemplate Types\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fIFAILOVER\fP \- Uses health check information on your endpoints to determine which DNS answers to serve. If an endpoint fails a health check, the answer for that endpoint will be removed from the list of available answers until the endpoint is detected as healthy.

.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fILOAD_BALANCE\fP \- Distributes web traffic to specified endpoints based on defined weights.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIROUTE_BY_GEO\fP \- Answers DNS queries based on the query’s geographic location. For a list of geographic locations to route by, see \fI\%Traffic Management Geographic Locations\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/TrafficManagement/Reference/trafficmanagementgeo.htm\fP>\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIROUTE_BY_ASN\fP \- Answers DNS queries based on the query’s originating ASN.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIROUTE_BY_IP\fP \- Answers DNS queries based on the query’s IP address.
.IP \(bu 2
\fICUSTOM\fP \- Allows a customized configuration of rules.

.TP
.B \-\-answers [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The set of all answers that can potentially issue from the steering policy.
.sp
This option is a JSON list with items of type SteeringPolicyAnswer.  For documentation on SteeringPolicyAnswer please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/dns/20180115/datatypes/SteeringPolicyAnswer\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.

.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id –> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with advanced JSON options” link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

.B \-\-health\-check\-monitor\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCID of the health check monitor providing health data about the answers of the steering policy. A steering policy answer with \fIrdata\fP matching a monitored endpoint will use the health data of that endpoint. A steering policy answer with \fIrdata\fP not matching any monitored endpoint will be assumed healthy.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP To use the Health Check monitoring feature in a steering policy, a monitor must be created using the Health Checks service first. For more information on how to create a monitor, please see \fI\%Managing Health Checks\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/HealthChecks/Tasks/managinghealthchecks.htm\fP>\&.
