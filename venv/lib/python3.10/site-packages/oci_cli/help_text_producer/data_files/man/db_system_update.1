.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Updates the properties of the specified DB system.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP Deprecated for Exadata Cloud Service systems. Use the \fI\%new resource model APIs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/exaflexsystem.htm#exaflexsystem_topic-resource_model\fP> instead.
.sp
For Exadata Cloud Service instances, support for this API will end on May 15th, 2021. See \fI\%Switching an Exadata DB System to the New Resource Model and APIs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/exaflexsystem_topic-resource_model_conversion.htm\fP> for details on converting existing Exadata DB systems to the new resource model.

.B \-\-backup\-network\-nsg\-ids [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A list of the \fI\%OCIDs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the network security groups (NSGs) that the backup network of this DB system belongs to. Setting this to an empty array after the list is created removes the resource from all NSGs. For more information about NSGs, see \fI\%Security Rules\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm\fP>\&. Applicable only to Exadata systems.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.

.sp
The size, in gigabytes, to scale the attached storage up to for this virtual machine DB system. This value must be greater than current storage size. Note that the resulting total storage size attached will be greater than the amount requested to allow for REDO/RECO space and software volume. Applies only to virtual machine DB systems.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.

.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id –> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with advanced JSON options” link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
