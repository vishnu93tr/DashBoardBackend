.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new load balancer in the specified compartment. For general information about load balancers, see \fI\%Overview of the Load Balancing Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Balance/Concepts/balanceoverview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the load balancer to reside. Notice that the load balancer doesn’t have to be in the same compartment as the VCN or backend set. If you’re not sure which compartment to use, put the load balancer in the same compartment as the VCN. For information about access control and compartments, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must specify a display name for the load balancer. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it.
.sp
For information about Availability Domains, see \fI\%Regions and Availability Domains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm\fP>\&. To get a list of Availability Domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including load balancers, get an Oracle\-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource’s OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console. Fore more information, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
After you send your request, the new object’s state will temporarily be PROVISIONING. Before using the object, first make sure its state has changed to RUNNING.
.sp
When you create a load balancer, the system assigns an IP address. To get the IP address, use the \fI\%GetLoadBalancer\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/lb/load-balancer/get.html\fP> operation.

When creating a load balancer, there are two main options:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Providing all information when calling the \fBcreate\fP command
.IP \(bu 2
Providing minimal information to the \fBcreate\fP command then then using individual commands to “assemble” the load balancer post\-creation
.UNINDENT
.sp
Working samples for both approaches can be found \fI\%here\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/oracle/oci-cli/blob/master/scripts/create_load_balancer.sh\fP>\&.
.SS Providing all information at create time
.sp
Under this option, you would call the \fBcreate\fP command and specify the \fB\-\-certificates\fP, \fB\-\-backend\-sets\fP, \fB\-\-listener\fP and \fB\-\-path\-route\-sets\fP options in order to also create these items when creating the load balancer. Since those options are complex types, it is recommended that you place their input in JSON files and then specify these files as input to the command using the \fI\%file://\fP syntax. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-backend\-sets file://path/to/backend/set/file.json
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can discover the format of the input you need to provide by using the \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input certificates
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input backend\-sets
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input listeners
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input path\-route\-sets
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As an alternative to providing those individal options, you can specify all the input to the command in a single file using the \fB\-\-from\-json\fP option. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-from\-json file://path/to/file/of/input.json
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can discover the format of the input you need to provide by using the \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Providing minimal information and then assembling via other commands
.sp
Under this option, you would only supply the mandatory arguments to the \fBcreate\fP command (and not any of the input marked as \fBCOMPLEX TYPE\fP) and then use other operations to add certificates, backend sets, listeners and path route sets. This approach is more applicable if you do not wish to prepare JSON input files.
.sp
The key commands you’ll need to be aware of are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
This command
.IP \(bu 2
Create certificate
.IP \(bu 2
Create backend set
.IP \(bu 2
Create backend
.IP \(bu 2
List protocols
.IP \(bu 2
Create listener
.IP \(bu 2
Create path route set
.UNINDENT
.sp
You would tie these together in sequence by:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Create load balancer with minimal attributes
oci lb load\-balancer create

# Create a certificate bundle associated with the load balancer (call command multiple times if needed)
oci lb certificate create

# Create a backend set associated with the load balancer (call command multiple times if needed)
# You may need the details of the certificate you previously created
oci lb backend\-set create

# Add multiple backends to the backend set
oci lb backend create
oci lb backend create

# Create a path route set for a particular listener of the load balancer to route traffic to appropriate back\-end set
oci lb path\-route\-set create

# Add a listener to the load balancer (call command multiple times if needed)
# This will take a \-\-protocol option, whose valid values you can discover by oci lb protocol lists
# You may also need the details of the certificate you previously created
