.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-app\-suite\-name [text]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP> Example: \fI{“Operations”: {“CostCenter”: “42”}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP

.UNINDENT
.sp
The description of the sensitive data model.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-display\-name [text]

.UNINDENT
.sp
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id –> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with advanced JSON options” link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-if\-match [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the if\-match parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource. The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource’s current etag value.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-is\-app\-defined\-relation\-discovery\-enabled [boolean]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Indicates if data discovery jobs should identify potential application\-level (non\-dictionary) referential relationships between columns. Note that data discovery automatically identifies and adds database\-level (dictionary\-defined) relationships. This option helps identify application\-level relationships that are not defined in the database dictionary, which in turn, helps identify additional sensitive columns and preserve referential integrity during data masking. It’s disabled by default and should be used only if there is a need to identify application\-level relationships.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-is\-sample\-data\-collection\-enabled [boolean]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Indicates if data discovery jobs should collect and store sample data values for the discovered columns. Sample data helps review the discovered columns and ensure that they actually contain sensitive data. As it collects original data from the target database, it’s disabled by default and should be used only if it’s acceptable to store sample data in Data Safe’s repository in Oracle Cloud. Note that sample data values are not collected for columns with the following data types: LONG, LOB, RAW, XMLTYPE and BFILE.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-schemas\-for\-discovery [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The schemas to be used for future data discovery jobs.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp

.B \-\-sensitive\-type\-group\-ids\-for\-discovery [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCIDs of the sensitive type groups to be used by data discovery jobs.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-sensitive\-type\-ids\-for\-discovery [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCIDs of the sensitive types to be used for future data discovery jobs. If OCID of a sensitive category is provided, all its child sensitive types are used for data discovery.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.

.TP
.B \-\-tables\-for\-discovery [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The data discovery jobs will scan the tables specified here, including both schemas and tables. For instance, the input could be in the format: [{schemaName: “HR”, tableName: [“T1”, “T2”]}, {schemaName: “OE”, tableName : [“T3”, “T4”]}].
.sp
This option is a JSON list with items of type TablesForDiscovery.  For documentation on TablesForDiscovery please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/datasafe/20181201/datatypes/TablesForDiscovery\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-target\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCID of the reference target database to be associated with the sensitive data model. All operations such as performing data discovery and adding columns manually are done in the context of the associated target database. Note that updating the targetId attribute does not perform data discovery automatically.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.sp
