.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Updates the Web Application Firewall configuration for a specified WAAS policy.
.sp
To update platform provided resources such as \fIGoodBots\fP, \fIProtectionRules\fP, and \fIThreatFeeds\fP, first retrieve the list of available resources with the related list operation, such as \fIGetThreatFeeds\fP or \fIGetProtectionRules\fP\&.
.sp
The returned list will contain objects with \fIkey\fP properties that can be used to update the resource during the \fIUpdateWafConfig\fP request.
