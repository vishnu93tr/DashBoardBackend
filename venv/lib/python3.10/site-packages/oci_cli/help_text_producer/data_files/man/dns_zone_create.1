.sp
Creates a new zone in the specified compartment.
.sp
Private zones must have a zone type of \fIPRIMARY\fP\&. Creating a private zone at or under \fIoraclevcn.com\fP within the default protected view of a VCN\-dedicated resolver is not permitted.

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.

.TP
.B \-\-dnssec\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The state of DNSSEC on the zone.
.sp
For DNSSEC to function, every parent zone in the DNS tree up to the top\-level domain (or an independent trust anchor) must also have DNSSEC correctly set up. After enabling DNSSEC, you must add a DS record to the zone’s parent zone containing the \fIKskDnssecKeyVersion\fP data. You can find the DS data in the \fIdsData\fP attribute of the \fIKskDnssecKeyVersion\fP\&. Then, use the \fIPromoteZoneDnssecKeyVersion\fP operation to promote the \fIKskDnssecKeyVersion\fP\&.
.sp
New \fIKskDnssecKeyVersion\(gas are generated annually, a week before the existing \(gaKskDnssecKeyVersion\fP’s expiration. To rollover a \fIKskDnssecKeyVersion\fP, you must replace the parent zone’s DS record containing the old \fIKskDnssecKeyVersion\fP data with the data from the new \fIKskDnssecKeyVersion\fP\&.
.sp
To remove the old DS record without causing service disruption, wait until the old DS record’s TTL has expired, and the new DS record has propagated. After the DS replacement has been completed, then the \fIPromoteZoneDnssecKeyVersion\fP operation must be called.
.sp
Metrics are emitted in the \fIoci_dns\fP namespace daily for each \fIKskDnssecKeyVersion\fP indicating how many days are left until expiration. We recommend that you set up alarms and notifications for KskDnssecKeyVersion expiration so that the necessary parent zone updates can be made and the \fIPromoteZoneDnssecKeyVersion\fP operation can be called.
.sp
Enabling DNSSEC results in additional records in DNS responses which increases their size and can cause higher response latency.
.sp

.B \-\-external\-downstreams [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
External secondary servers for the zone. This field is currently not supported when \fIzoneType\fP is \fISECONDARY\fP or \fIscope\fP is \fIPRIVATE\fP\&.
.sp
This option is a JSON list with items of type ExternalDownstream.  For documentation on ExternalDownstream please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/dns/20180115/datatypes/ExternalDownstream\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using

.B \-\-external\-masters [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
External master servers for the zone. \fIexternalMasters\fP becomes a required parameter when the \fIzoneType\fP value is \fISECONDARY\fP\&.
.sp
This option is a JSON list with items of type ExternalMaster.  For documentation on ExternalMaster please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/dns/20180115/datatypes/ExternalMaster\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using

.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id –> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with advanced JSON options” link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
