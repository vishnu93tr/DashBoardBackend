.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new user in your tenancy. For conceptual information about users, your tenancy, and other IAM Service components, see \fI\%Overview of IAM\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com//Content/Identity/getstarted/identity-domains.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must specify your tenancy’s OCID as the compartment ID in the request object (remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment). Notice that IAM resources (users, groups, compartments, and some policies) reside within the tenancy itself, unlike cloud resources such as compute instances, which typically reside within compartments inside the tenancy. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIname\fP for the user, which must be unique across all users in your tenancy and cannot be changed. Allowed characters: No spaces. Only letters, numerals, hyphens, periods, underscores, +, and @. If you specify a name that’s already in use, you’ll get a 409 error. This name will be the user’s login to the Console. You might want to pick a name that your company’s own identity system (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, etc.) already uses. If you delete a user and then create a new user with the same name, they’ll be considered different users because they have different OCIDs.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIdescription\fP for the user (although it can be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with \fI\%UpdateUser\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/iam/user/update.html\fP>\&. You can use the field to provide the user’s full name, a description, a nickname, or other information to generally identify the user.
.sp
After you send your request, the new object’s \fIlifecycleState\fP will temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its \fIlifecycleState\fP has changed to ACTIVE.
.sp
A new user has no permissions until you place the user in one or more groups (see \fI\%AddUserToGroup\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/UserGroupMembership/AddUserToGroup\fP>). If the user needs to access the Console, you need to provide the user a password (see \fI\%CreateOrResetUIPassword\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/iam/user/ui-password/create-or-reset.html\fP>). If the user needs to access the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure REST API, you need to upload a public API signing key for that user (see \fI\%Required Keys and OCIDs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm\fP> and also \fI\%UploadApiKey\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/iam/user/api-key/upload.html\fP>).
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP Make sure to inform the new user which compartment(s) they have access to.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-description [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The description you assign to the user during creation. Does not have to be unique, and it’s changeable.
.sp
(For tenancies that support identity domains) You can have an empty description.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-name [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The name you assign to the user during creation. This is the user’s login for the Console. The name must be unique across all users in the tenancy and cannot be changed.
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCID of the tenancy containing the user. If not provided, this parameter will use the tenancy’s OCID (root compartment’s OCID) from the config file.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{“Operations”: {“CostCenter”: “42”}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-email [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The email you assign to the user during creation. The email must be unique across all users in the tenancy.
.sp
(For tenancies that support identity domains) You must provide an email for each user.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{“Department”: “Finance”}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id –> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with advanced JSON options” link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

.TP
.B \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
