.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCID of compartment in which to call the Generative AI service to generate text.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-inference\-request\-prompt [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Represents the prompt to be completed. The trailing white spaces are trimmed before completion.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-serving\-mode [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS Optional Parameters
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id –> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with advanced JSON options” link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-inference\-request\-frequency\-penalty [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
To reduce repetitiveness of generated tokens, this number penalizes new tokens based on their frequency in the generated text so far. Greater numbers encourage the model to use new tokens, while lower numbers encourage the model to repeat the tokens. Set to 0 to disable.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-inference\-request\-is\-echo [boolean]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Whether or not to return the user prompt in the response. This option only applies to non\-stream results.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-inference\-request\-is\-stream [boolean]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens are sent as data\-only server\-sent events as they become available.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-inference\-request\-max\-tokens [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The maximum number of tokens to predict for each response. Includes input plus output tokens.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-inference\-request\-num\-generations [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The number of generated texts that will be returned.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-inference\-request\-presence\-penalty [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
To reduce repetitiveness of generated tokens, this number penalizes new tokens based on whether they’ve appeared in the generated text so far. Greater numbers encourage the model to use new tokens, while lower numbers encourage the model to repeat the tokens.
.sp
Similar to frequency penalty, a penalty is applied to previously present tokens, except that this penalty is applied equally to all tokens that have already appeared, regardless of how many times they’ve appeared. Set to 0 to disable.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-inference\-request\-return\-likelihoods [text]

Specifies how and if the token likelihoods are returned with the response.

.B \-\-inference\-request\-stop\-sequences [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The generated text is cut at the end of the earliest occurrence of this stop sequence. The generated text will include this stop sequence.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-inference\-request\-temperature [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A number that sets the randomness of the generated output. A lower temperature means a less random generations.
.sp
Use lower numbers for tasks with a correct answer such as question answering or summarizing. High temperatures can generate hallucinations or factually incorrect information. Start with temperatures lower than 1.0 and increase the temperature for more creative outputs, as you regenerate the prompts to refine the outputs.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-inference\-request\-top\-k [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
An integer that sets up the model to use only the top k most likely tokens in the generated output. A higher k introduces more randomness into the output making the output text sound more natural. Default value is 0 which disables this method and considers all tokens. To set a number for the likely tokens, choose an integer between 1 and 500.
.sp
If also using top p, then the model considers only the top tokens whose probabilities add up to p percent and ignores the rest of the k tokens. For example, if k is 20, but the probabilities of the top 10 add up to .75, then only the top 10 tokens are chosen.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-inference\-request\-top\-p [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
If set to a probability 0.0 < p < 1.0, it ensures that only the most likely tokens, with total probability mass of p, are considered for generation at each step.
.sp
To eliminate tokens with low likelihood, assign p a minimum percentage for the next token’s likelihood. For example, when p is set to 0.75, the model eliminates the bottom 25 percent for the next token. Set to 1.0 to consider all tokens and set to 0 to disable. If both k and p are enabled, p acts after k.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-inference\-request\-truncate [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
For an input that’s longer than the maximum token length, specifies which part of the input text will be truncated.
