Description
===========

Oracle Delegate Access Control allows ExaCC and ExaCS customers to
delegate management of their Exadata resources operators outside their
tenancies. With Delegate Access Control, Support Providers can deliver
managed services using comprehensive and robust tooling built on the
OCI platform. Customers maintain control over who has access to the
delegated resources in their tenancy and what actions can be taken.
Enterprises managing resources across multiple tenants can use
Delegate Access Control to streamline management tasks. Using logging
service, customers can view a near real-time audit report of all
actions performed by a Service Provider operator.
