Usage
=====

   oci database-migration connection create-mysql-connection [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment.

--database-name [text]

The name of the database being referenced.

--display-name [text]

A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it’s changeable.
Avoid entering confidential information.

--key-id [text]

The OCID of the key used in cryptographic operations.

--password [text]

The password (credential) used when creating or updating this
resource.

--security-protocol [text]

Security Type for MySQL.

--technology-type [text]

The type of MySQL source or target connection. Example: OCI_MYSQL
represents OCI MySQL HeatWave Database Service

--username [text]

The username (credential) used when creating or updating this
resource.

--vault-id [text]

OCI resource ID.


Optional Parameters
===================

--additional-attributes [complex type]

An array of name-value pair attribute entries.

This option is a JSON list with items of type NameValuePair.  For
documentation on NameValuePair please see our API reference: https://
docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/databasemigration/20230518/datatypes/N
ameValuePair. This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON.
The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in
as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--db-system-id [text]

The OCID of the database system being referenced.

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. Example: *{“foo-namespace”: {“bar-key”: “value”}}* This is
a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be
provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--description [text]

A user-friendly description. Does not have to be unique, and it’s
changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags. Example: {“Department”: “Finance”} This is a complex
type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
string on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--host [text]

The IP Address of the host.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--nsg-ids [complex type]

An array of Network Security Group OCIDs used to define network access
for Connections. This is a complex type whose value must be valid
JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or
passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--port [integer]

The port to be used for the connection.

--replication-password [text]

The password (credential) used when creating or updating this
resource.

--replication-username [text]

The username (credential) used when creating or updating this

containing the server public key (for 1 and 2-way SSL).

--ssl-cert [text]

Client Certificate - The base64 encoded content of client-cert.pem
file containing the client public key (for 2-way SSL).

--ssl-crl [text]

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource
and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation.
Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work
request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified,
returning on the first state. For example, "--wait-for-state"
SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on whichever
lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code
of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACCEPTED, CANCELED, CANCELING, FAILED, IN_PROGRESS, SUCCEEDED, WAITING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the work request
has reached the state defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 30
seconds.
