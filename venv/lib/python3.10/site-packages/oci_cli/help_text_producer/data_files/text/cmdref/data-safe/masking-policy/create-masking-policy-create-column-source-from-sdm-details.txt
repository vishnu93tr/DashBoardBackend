Description
===========

Creates a new masking policy and associates it with a sensitive data
model or a target database.

To use a sensitive data model as the source of masking columns, set
the columnSource attribute to SENSITIVE_DATA_MODEL and provide the
sensitiveDataModelId attribute. After creating a masking policy, you
can use the AddMaskingColumnsFromSdm operation to automatically add
all the columns from the associated sensitive data model. In this
case, the target database associated with the sensitive data model is
used for column and masking format validations.

You can also create a masking policy without using a sensitive data
model. In this case, you need to associate your masking policy with a
target database by setting the columnSource attribute to TARGET and
providing the targetId attribute. The specified target database is
used for column and masking format validations.

After creating a masking policy, you can use the CreateMaskingColumn
or PatchMaskingColumns operation to manually add columns to the
policy. You need to add the parent columns only, and it automatically
adds the child columns (in referential relationship with the parent
columns) from the associated sensitive data model or target database.


Usage
=====

   oci data-safe masking-policy create-masking-policy-create-column-source-from-sdm-details [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--column-source-sensitive-data-model-id [text]

The OCID of the sensitive data model to be associated as the column
source with the masking policy.

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment where the masking policy should be
created.


Optional Parameters
===================

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags Example:
*{“Operations”: {“CostCenter”: “42”}}* This is a complex type whose
value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the
command line or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file
syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--description [text]

The description of the masking policy.

--display-name [text]

The display name of the masking policy. The name does not have to be
unique, and it’s changeable.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags

Example:

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--is-drop-temp-tables-enabled [boolean]

Indicates if the temporary tables created during a masking operation
should be dropped after masking. It’s enabled by default. Set this
attribute to false to preserve the temporary tables. Masking creates
temporary tables that map the original sensitive data values to mask
values. By default, these temporary tables are dropped after masking.
But, in some cases, you may want to preserve this information to track
how masking changed your data. Note that doing so compromises
security. These tables must be dropped before the database is
available for unprivileged users.

--is-redo-logging-enabled [boolean]

Indicates if redo logging is enabled during a masking operation. It’s
disabled by default. Set this attribute to true to enable redo
logging. By default, masking disables redo logging and flashback
logging to purge any original unmasked data from logs. However, in
certain circumstances when you only want to test masking, rollback
changes, and retry masking, you could enable logging and use a
flashback database to retrieve the original unmasked data after it has
been masked.

--is-refresh-stats-enabled [boolean]

Indicates if statistics gathering is enabled. It’s enabled by default.
Set this attribute to false to disable statistics gathering. The
masking process gathers statistics on masked database tables after
masking completes.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--parallel-degree [text]

Specifies options to enable parallel execution when running data
masking. Allowed values are ‘NONE’ (no parallelism), ‘DEFAULT’ (the
Oracle Database computes the optimum degree of parallelism) or an
integer value to be used as the degree of parallelism. Parallel
execution helps effectively use multiple CPUs and improve masking
performance. Refer to the Oracle Database parallel execution framework
when choosing an explicit degree of parallelism.

--post-masking-script [text]

A post-masking script, which can contain SQL and PL/SQL statements.
It’s executed after the core masking script generated using the
masking policy. It’s usually used to perform additional transformation
or cleanup work after masking.

--pre-masking-script [text]

A pre-masking script, which can contain SQL and PL/SQL statements.
It’s executed before the core masking script generated using the
masking policy. It’s usually used to perform any preparation or
prerequisite work before masking data.

--recompile [text]

Specifies how to recompile invalid objects post data masking. Allowed
values are ‘SERIAL’ (recompile in serial), ‘PARALLEL’ (recompile in
parallel), ‘NONE’ (do not recompile). If it’s set to PARALLEL, the
value of parallelDegree attribute is used. Use the built-in UTL_RECOMP
package to recompile any remaining invalid objects after masking
completes.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource
and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation.
Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work
request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified,
returning on the first state. For example, "--wait-for-state"
SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on whichever
lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code
of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACCEPTED, CANCELED, CANCELING, FAILED, IN_PROGRESS, SUCCEEDED, SUSPENDED, SUSPENDING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the work request
has reached the state defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 30
seconds.
