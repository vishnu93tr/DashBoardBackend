**********************


Description
===========

A library masking format is a masking format stored in an Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure compartment and can be used in multiple masking
policies. If you want to use the same masking logic for multiple
masking columns or even in multiple masking policies, you can create a
library masking format and assign it to masking columns as needed. It
helps you avoid defining the same masking logic again and again.

Oracle Data Safe provides a set of predefined library masking formats
to mask common sensitive and personal data, such as names, national
identifiers, credit card numbers, and phone numbers. To meet your
specific requirements, you can easily create new library masking
formats and use them in your masking policies.
