Description
===========

An agent is an LLM-based autonomous system that understands and
generates human-like text, enabling natural-language processing
interactions. OCI Generative AI Agents supports retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) agents. A RAG agent connects to a data source,
retrieves data, and augments model responses with the information from
the data sources to generate more relevant responses.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
