work-requests
*************


Description
===========

Many of the CLI operations that you use to create and configure
Compute resources do not take effect immediately. In these cases, the
operation spawns an asynchronous workflow to fulfill the request. Work
requests provide visibility into the status of these in-progress,
long-running workflows.

For more information about work requests and the operations that spawn
work requests, see Viewing the State of a Compute Work Request.
