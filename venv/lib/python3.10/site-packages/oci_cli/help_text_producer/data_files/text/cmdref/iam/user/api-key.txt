api-key
*******


Description
===========

A PEM-format RSA credential for securing requests to the Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure REST API. Also known as an *API signing key*.
Specifically, this is the public key from the key pair. The private
key remains with the user calling the API. For information about
generating a key pair in the required PEM format, see Required Keys
and OCIDs.

**Important:** This is **not** the SSH key for accessing compute
instances.

Each user can have a maximum of three API signing keys.

For more information about user credentials, see User Credentials.
