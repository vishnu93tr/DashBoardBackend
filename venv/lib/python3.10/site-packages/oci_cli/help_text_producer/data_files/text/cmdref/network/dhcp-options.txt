dhcp-options
************


Description
===========

A set of DHCP options. Used by the VCN to automatically provide
configuration information to the instances when they boot up. There
are two options you can set:

* DhcpDnsOption: Lets you specify how DNS (hostname resolution) is
  handled in the subnets in your VCN.

* DhcpSearchDomainOption: Lets you specify a search domain name to use
  for DNS queries.

For more information, see  DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network and DHCP
Options.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
