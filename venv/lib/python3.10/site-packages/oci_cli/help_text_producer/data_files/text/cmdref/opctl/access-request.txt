access-request
**************


Description
===========

An Oracle operator raises access request when they need access to any
infrastructure resource governed by Operator Access Control. The
access request identifies the target resource and the set of operator
actions. Access request handling depends upon the Operator Control
that governs the target resource, and the set of operator actions
listed for approval in the access request. If all of the operator
actions listed in the access request are in the pre-approved list in
the Operator Control that governs the target resource, then the access
request is automatically approved. If not, then the access request
requires explicit approval from the approver group specified by the
Operator Control governing the target resource.

You can approve or reject an access request. You can also revoke the
approval of an already approved access request. While creating an
access request, the operator specifies the duration of access. You
have the option to approve the entire duration or reduce or even
increase the time duration. An operator can also request for an
extension. The approval for such an extension is processed the same
way the original access request was processed.
