Description
===========

Autoscaling policies define the criteria that trigger autoscaling
actions and the actions to take.

An autoscaling policy is part of an autoscaling configuration. For
more information, see Autoscaling.

You can create the following types of autoscaling policies:

   * **Schedule-based:** Autoscaling events take place at the specific
     times that you schedule.   - **Threshold-based:** An autoscaling
     action is triggered when a performance metric meets or exceeds a
     threshold.
