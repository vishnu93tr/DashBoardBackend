Description
===========

When you create a data source, you specify the location of the data
files. To make those files usable by an agent, you must download them
into the agent’s associated knowledge base, a process known as data
ingestion. Data ingestion is a process that extracts data from data
source documents, converts it into a structured format suitable for
analysis, and then stores it in a knowledge base.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
