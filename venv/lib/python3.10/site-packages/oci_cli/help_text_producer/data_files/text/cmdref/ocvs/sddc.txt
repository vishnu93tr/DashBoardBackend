Description
===========

An Oracle Cloud VMware Solution software-defined data center (SDDC)
contains the resources required for a functional VMware environment.
Instances in an SDDC (see EsxiHost) run in a virtual cloud network
(VCN) and are preconfigured with VMware and storage. Use the vCenter
utility to manage and deploy VMware virtual machines (VMs) in the
SDDC.

The SDDC uses a single management subnet for provisioning the SDDC. It
also uses a set of VLANs for various components of the VMware
environment (vSphere, vMotion, vSAN, and so on). See the Core Services
API for information about VCN subnets and VLANs.
