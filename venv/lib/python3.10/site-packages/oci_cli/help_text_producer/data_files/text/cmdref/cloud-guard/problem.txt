Description
===========

Problems are at the core of Cloud Guard’s functionality. A Problem
resource is created whenever an action or a configuration on a
resource triggers a rule in a detector that’s attached to the target
containing the compartment where the resource is located. Each Problem
resource contains all the details for a single problem. This is the
information for the problem that appears on the Cloud Guard Problems
page.
