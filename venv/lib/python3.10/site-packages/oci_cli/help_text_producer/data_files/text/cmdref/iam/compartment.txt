compartment
***********


Description
===========

A collection of related resources. Compartments are a fundamental
component of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for organizing and isolating
your cloud resources. You use them to clearly separate resources for
the purposes of measuring usage and billing, access (through the use
of IAM Service policies), and isolation (separating the resources for
one project or business unit from another). A common approach is to
create a compartment for each major part of your organization. For
more information, see Overview of IAM and also Setting Up Your
Tenancy.

To place a resource in a compartment, simply specify the compartment
ID in the “Create” request object when initially creating the
resource. For example, to launch an instance into a particular
compartment, specify that compartment’s OCID in the *LaunchInstance*
request. You can’t move an existing resource from one compartment to
another.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Get Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
