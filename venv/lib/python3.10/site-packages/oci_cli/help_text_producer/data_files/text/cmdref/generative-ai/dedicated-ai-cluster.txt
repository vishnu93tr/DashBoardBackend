Description
===========

Dedicated AI clusters are compute resources that you can use for fine-
tuning custom models or for hosting endpoints for custom models. The
clusters are dedicated to your models and not shared with users in
other tenancies.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If youâ€™re not authorized, talk to an administrator who gives
OCI resource access to users. See Getting Started with Policies and
Getting Access to Generative AI Resources.
