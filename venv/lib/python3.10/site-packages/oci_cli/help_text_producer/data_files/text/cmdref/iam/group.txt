group
*****


Description
===========

A collection of users who all need the same type of access to a
particular set of resources or compartment. For conceptual information
about groups and other IAM Service components, see Overview of IAM.

If you’re federating with an identity provider (IdP), you need to
create mappings between the groups defined in the IdP and groups you
define in the IAM service. For more information, see Identity
Providers and Federation. Also see IdentityProvider and
IdpGroupMapping.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Get Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
