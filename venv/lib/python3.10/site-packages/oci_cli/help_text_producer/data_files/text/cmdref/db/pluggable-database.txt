pluggable-database
******************


Description
===========

A pluggable database (PDB) is portable collection of schemas, schema
objects, and non-schema objects that appears to an Oracle client as a
non-container database. To use a PDB, it needs to be plugged into a
CDB. To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an
IAM policy. If you are not authorized, talk to a tenancy
administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies
to give users access, see Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
