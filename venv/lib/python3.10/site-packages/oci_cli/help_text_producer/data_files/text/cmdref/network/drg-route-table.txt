drg-route-table
***************


Description
===========

All routing inside the DRG is driven by the contents of DRG route
tables. DRG route tables contain rules which route packets to a
particular network destination, represented as a DRG attachment. The
routing decision for a packet entering a DRG is determined by the
rules in the DRG route table assigned to the attachment-of-entry.

Each DRG attachment can inject routes in any DRG route table, provided
there is a statement corresponding to the attachment in the route
tableâ€™s *importDrgRouteDistribution*. You can also insert static
routes into the DRG route tables.

The DRG route table is always in the same compartment as the DRG.
There must always be a default DRG route table for each attachment
type.
