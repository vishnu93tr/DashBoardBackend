replication-target
******************


Description
===========

Replication targets are associated with a primary resource called a
>>``<<Replication`
<https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Replication>`__
located in another availability domain in the same or different
region. The replication retrieves the delta of data between two
snapshots of a source file system and sends it to the associated
*ReplicationTarget*,  which applies it to the target file system. All
operations (except *DELETE*) must be done using the associated
replication resource. Deleting a *ReplicationTarget* allows the target
file system to be exported. Deleting a *ReplicationTarget* does not
delete the associated *Replication* resource, but places it in a
*FAILED* state. For more information, see File System Replication.
