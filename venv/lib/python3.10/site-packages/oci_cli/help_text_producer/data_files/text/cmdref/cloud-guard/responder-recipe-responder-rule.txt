Description
===========

A ResponderRecipeRule resource contains a specific instance of a
single responder rule.

A ResponderRecipeRule resource: * Is effectively a copy of a
ResponderRule resource in which users can make certain changes if it’s
Oracle-managed, and other changes if it’s user-managed. * Can also be
created by cloning an existing ResponderRecipe resource, either user-
managed or Oracle-managed; cloning the ResponderRecipe resource also
clones its associated ResponderRule resources as ResponderRecipeRule
resources. * Is visible on the Cloud Guard Responder Recipes,
Responder Details page. * Is effectively located in a specific OCI
compartment, through the ResponderRecipe resource to which it belongs.
* Can be modified by users, programmatically or through the UI. *
Changes that can be made here apply globally, to all resources in OCI
compartments mapped to a target that attaches the associated responder
recipe (in a TargetResponderRecipe resource), but are overridden by
changes made in the corresponding TargetResponderRecipe resource
(which is effectively a copy of the ResponderRecipe resource). type:
object
