************************************


Description
===========

A TargetDetectorRecipeDetectorRule resource contains a specific
instance of a single detector rule in one of the supported detector
types (for example, activity, configuration, or threat).

A TargetDetectorRecipeDetectorRule resource: * Is effectively a copy
of a DetectorRecipeRule resource (made when a detector recipe is
attached to a target) in which users can make certain changes if it’s
Oracle-managed, and other changes if it’s user-managed. * Is visible
on the Cloud Guard Targets, Target Details page. * Is effectively
located in a specific OCI compartment, through the
ThreatDetectorRecipe resource to which it belongs. * Can be modified
by users, programmatically or through the UI. * Changes that can be
made here apply locally, to resources in OCI compartments mapped to
the target that attaches the associated detector recipe (in a
TargetDetectorRecipe resource), and override any changes made in rules
associated with the corresponding DetectorRecipe resource.
