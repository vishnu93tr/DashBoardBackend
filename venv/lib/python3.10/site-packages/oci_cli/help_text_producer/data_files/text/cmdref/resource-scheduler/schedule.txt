Description
===========

A Schedule describes the date and time when an operation will be or
has been applied to a set of resources. You must specify either the
resources directly or provide a set of resource filters to select the
resources.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, contact your administrator. If
you’re an administrator who needs to write policies to give users
access, see Getting Started with Policies.
