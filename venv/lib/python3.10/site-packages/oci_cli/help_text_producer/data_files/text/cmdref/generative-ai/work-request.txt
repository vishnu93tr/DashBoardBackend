Description
===========

An asynchronous work request. When you start a long-running operation,
the service creates a work request. Work requests help you monitor
long-running operations.

A work request is an activity log that lets you track each step in the
operationâ€™s progress. Each work request has an OCID that lets you
interact with it programmatically and use it for automation.
