Description
===========

This schema defines the attributes of Trusted User Agents owned by
users. Multi-Factor Authentication uses Trusted User Agents to
authenticate users.  A User Agent is software application that a user
uses to issue requests.
   For example, a User Agent could be a particular browser (possibly
   one of several executing on a desktop or laptop) or a particular
   mobile application (again, one of several executing on a particular
   mobile device). A User Agent is trusted once the Multi-Factor
   Authentication has verified it in some way.
