Description
===========

Full glossary details. A glossary of business terms, such as
‘Customer’, ‘Account’, ‘Contact’ , ‘Address’, or ‘Product’, with
definitions, used to provide common meaning across disparate data
assets. Business glossaries may be hierarchical where some terms may
contain child terms to allow them to be used as ‘taxonomies’. By
linking data assets, data entities, and attributes to glossaries and
glossary terms, the glossary can act as a way of organizing data
catalog objects in a hierarchy to make a large number of objects more
navigable and easier to consume. Objects in the data aatalog, such as
data assets or data entities, may be linked to any level in the
glossary, so that the glossary can be used to browse the available
data according to the business model of the organization.
