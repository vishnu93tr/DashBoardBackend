(e.g. LocalClone, RemoteClone, Relocate ) with this API. Use the
StartPluggableDatabase and StopPluggableDatabase APIs to start and
stop the pluggable database.


Usage
=====

   oci db pluggable-database create-remote-clone [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--cdb-id [text]

The OCID of the CDB

--pdb-name [text]

The name for the pluggable database (PDB). The name is unique in the
context of a container database. The name must begin with an
alphabetic character and can contain a maximum of thirty alphanumeric
characters. Special characters are not permitted. The pluggable
database name should not be same as the container database name.

--source-cdb-admin-password [text]

The DB system administrator password of the source Container Database.

--source-pdb-id [text]

The OCID of the Source Pluggable Database.


Optional Parameters
===================

--cdb-admin-password [text]

The DB system administrator password of the Container Database.

--create-pdb-backup [boolean]

Indicates whether to take Pluggable Database Backup after the
operation.

--dblink-user-password [text]

The DB link user password.

--dblink-username [text]

The name of the DB link user.

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags. This is a complex
type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
string on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--is-refreshable-clone [boolean]

Indicates whether Pluggable Database will be refreshable. If false,
pluggable database will not be created as refreshable. If true, the
pluggable database will be created as refreshable.

--is-thin-clone [boolean]

True if Pluggable Database needs to be thin cloned and false if
Pluggable Database needs to be thick cloned.

--lock-pdb-admin-account [boolean]

The locked mode of the pluggable database admin account. If false, the
user needs to provide the PDB Admin Password to connect to it. If
true, the pluggable database will be locked and user cannot login to
it.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--pdb-admin-password [text]

A strong password for PDB Admin. The password must be at least nine
characters and contain at least two uppercase, two lowercase, two
numbers, and two special characters. The special characters must be _,
#, or -.

--tde-wallet-password [text]

The existing TDE wallet password of the CDB.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   AVAILABLE, BACKUP_IN_PROGRESS, DISABLED, FAILED, PROVISIONING, REFRESHING, RELOCATED, RELOCATING, RESTORE_FAILED, RESTORE_IN_PROGRESS, TERMINATED, TERMINATING, UPDATING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource has
reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to
30 seconds.
