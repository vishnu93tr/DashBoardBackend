* Example using required parameter


Description
===========

Gets a list of aggregated user profile details in the specified
compartment. This provides information about the overall profiles
available. For example, the user profile details include how many
users have the profile assigned and do how many use password
verification function. This data is especially useful content for
dashboards or to support analytics.

When you perform the ListProfileAnalytics operation, if the parameter
compartmentIdInSubtree is set to “true,” and if the parameter
accessLevel is set to ACCESSIBLE, then the operation returns
compartments in which the requestor has INSPECT permissions on at
least one resource, directly or indirectly (in subcompartments). If
the operation is performed at the root compartment and the requestor
does not have access to at least one subcompartment of the compartment
specified by compartmentId, then “Not Authorized” is returned.

The parameter compartmentIdInSubtree applies when you perform
ListProfileAnalytics on the compartmentId passed and when it is set to
true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.

To use ListProfileAnalytics to get a full list of all compartments and
subcompartments in the tenancy from the root compartment, set the
parameter compartmentIdInSubtree to true and accessLevel to
ACCESSIBLE.


Usage
=====

   oci data-safe profile list-profile-analytics [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

A filter to return only resources that match the specified compartment
OCID.

--user-assessment-id [text]

The OCID of the user assessment.


Optional Parameters
===================

--access-level [text]

Valid values are RESTRICTED and ACCESSIBLE. Default is RESTRICTED.
Setting this to ACCESSIBLE returns only those compartments for which
the user has INSPECT permissions directly or indirectly (permissions
can be on a resource in a subcompartment). When set to RESTRICTED
permissions are checked and no partial results are displayed.

Accepted values are:

   ACCESSIBLE, RESTRICTED

--all

Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you
cannot provide the "--limit" option.

--compartment-id-in-subtree [boolean]

Default is false. When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is
traversed and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are
returned. Depends on the ‘accessLevel’ setting.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--limit [integer]

For list pagination. The maximum number of items to return per page in
a paginated “List” call. For details about how pagination works, see
List Pagination.

--page [text]

For list pagination. The page token representing the page at which to
start retrieving results. It is usually retrieved from a previous
“List” call. For details about how pagination works, see List
Pagination.

--page-size [integer]

When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only
valid when used with "--all" or "--limit", and ignored otherwise.

--profile-name [text]

A filter to return only items that match the specified profile name.

--sort-by [text]

The field used for sorting. Only one sorting order (sortOrder) can be
specified. The default order for TIMECREATED is descending. The
default order for DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort order
is case sensitive.

Accepted values are:

   DISPLAYNAME, TIMECREATED

--sort-order [text]

The sort order to use, either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC).

Accepted values are:

   ASC, DESC

--target-id [text]

A filter to return only items related to a specific target OCID.
