Description
===========

Many of the API requests you use to create and configure load
balancing do not take effect immediately. In these cases, the request
spawns an asynchronous work flow to fulfill the request. WorkRequest
objects provide visibility for in-progress work flows. For more
information about work requests, see Viewing the State of a Work
Request.
