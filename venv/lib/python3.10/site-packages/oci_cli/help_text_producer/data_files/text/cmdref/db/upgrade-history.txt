To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM

are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access,
see Getting Started with Policies.

For information about access control and compartments, see Overview of
the Identity Service.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
