Description
===========

Lists the Connection Assignments in the compartment.


Usage
=====

   oci goldengate connection-assignment list [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment that contains the work request. Work
requests should be scoped to the same compartment as the resource the
work request affects. If the work request concerns multiple resources,
and those resources are not in the same compartment, it is up to the
service team to pick the primary resource whose compartment should be
used.


Optional Parameters
===================

--all

Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you
cannot provide the "--limit" option.

--connection-id [text]

The OCID of the connection.

--deployment-id [text]

The OCID of the deployment in which to list resources.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--lifecycle-state [text]

A filter to return only connection assignments having the
‘lifecycleState’ given.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, CREATING, DELETING, FAILED, UPDATING

--limit [integer]

The maximum number of items to return.

--name [text]

The name of the connection in the assignment (aliasName).

--page [text]

The page token representing the page at which to start retrieving
results. This is usually retrieved from a previous list call.

--page-size [integer]

When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only
valid when used with "--all" or "--limit", and ignored otherwise.

--sort-by [text]

The field to sort by. Only one sort order can be provided. Default
order for ‘timeCreated’ is descending.  Default order for
‘displayName’ is ascending. If no value is specified timeCreated is
the default.

Accepted values are:

   displayName, timeCreated

--sort-order [text]

The sort order to use, either ‘asc’ or ‘desc’.

Accepted values are:

   ASC, DESC
