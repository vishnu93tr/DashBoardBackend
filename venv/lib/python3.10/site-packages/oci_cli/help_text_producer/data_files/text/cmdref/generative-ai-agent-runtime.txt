Description
===========

OCI Generative AI Agents is a fully managed service that combines the
power of large language models (LLMs) with an intelligent retrieval
system to create contextually relevant answers by searching your
knowledge base, making your AI applications smart and efficient.

OCI Generative AI Agents supports several ways to onboard your data
and then allows you and your customers to interact with your data
using a chat interface or CLI.

Use the Generative AI Agents Client CLI to create and manage client
chat sessions. A session represents an interactive conversation
initiated by a user through an CLI to engage with an agent. It
involves a series of exchanges where the user sends queries or
prompts, and the agent responds with relevant information, actions, or
assistance based on the userâ€™s input. The session persists for the
duration of the interaction, maintaining context and continuity to
provide coherent and meaningful responses throughout the conversation.

For creating and managing agents, knowledge bases, data sources,
endpoints, and data ingestion jobs see the [Generative AI Agents
Management CLI].

To learn more about the service, see the Generative AI Agents
documentation.
