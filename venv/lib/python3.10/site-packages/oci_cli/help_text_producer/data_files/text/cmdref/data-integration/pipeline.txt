pipeline
********


Description
===========

A pipeline is a logical grouping of tasks that together perform a
higher level operation. For example, a pipeline could contain a set of
tasks that load and clean data, then execute a dataflow to analyze the
data. The pipeline allows you to manage the activities as a unit
instead of individually. Users can also schedule the pipeline instead
of the tasks independently.
