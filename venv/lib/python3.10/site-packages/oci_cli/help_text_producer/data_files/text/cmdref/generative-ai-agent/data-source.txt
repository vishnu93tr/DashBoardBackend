data-source
***********


Description
===========

A data source points to the source of your data. After you add a data
source to a knowledge base, you must ingest the data source’s data, so
that agents using the knowledge base can refer to the data.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
