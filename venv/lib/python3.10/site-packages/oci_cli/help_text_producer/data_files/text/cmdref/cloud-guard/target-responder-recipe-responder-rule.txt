Description
===========

A TargetResponderRecipeResponderRule resource contains a specific
instance of a single responder rule.

A TargetResponderRecipeRule resource: * Is effectively a copy of a
ResponderRecipeRule resource in which users can make certain changes
if it’s Oracle-managed, and other changes if it’s user-managed. * Is
visible on the Cloud Guard Targets, Target Details page. * Is
effectively located in a specific OCI compartment, through the
ThreatResponderRecipe resource to which it belongs. * Can be modified
by users, programmatically or through the UI. * Changes that can be
made here apply locally, to resources in OCI compartments mapped to
the target that attaches the associated responder recipe (in a
TargetResponderRecipe resource), and override any changes made in
rules associated with the corresponding ResponderRecipe resource.
