Description
===========

For use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect.

A virtual circuit is an isolated network path that runs over one or
more physical network connections to provide a single, logical
connection between the edge router on the customer’s existing network
and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. *Private* virtual circuits support
private peering, and *public* virtual circuits support public peering.
For more information, see FastConnect Overview.

Each virtual circuit is made up of information shared between a
customer, Oracle, and a provider (if the customer is using FastConnect
via a provider). Who fills in a given property of a virtual circuit
depends on whether the BGP session related to that virtual circuit
goes from the customer’s edge router to Oracle, or from the provider’s
edge router to Oracle. Also, in the case where the customer is using a
provider, values for some of the properties may not be present
immediately, but may get filled in as the provider and Oracle each do
their part to provision the virtual circuit.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
