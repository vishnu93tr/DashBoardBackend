"list-audit-events"
*******************

* Description

* Optional Parameters

* Global Parameters

* Example using required parameter


Description
===========

The ListAuditEvents operation returns specified *compartmentId* audit
Events only. The list does not include any audit Events associated
with the *subcompartments* of the specified *compartmentId*.

The parameter *accessLevel* specifies whether to return only those
compartments for which the requestor has INSPECT permissions on at
least one resource directly or indirectly (ACCESSIBLE) (the resource
can be in a subcompartment) or to return Not Authorized if Principal
doesn’t have access to even one of the child compartments. This is
valid only when *compartmentIdInSubtree* is set to *true*.

The parameter *compartmentIdInSubtree* applies when you perform
ListAuditEvents on the *compartmentId* passed and when it is set to
true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned. To get a
full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root
compartment), set the parameter *compartmentIdInSubtree* to true and
*accessLevel* to ACCESSIBLE.


Usage
=====

   oci data-safe audit-event-summary list-audit-events [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

A filter to return only resources that match the specified compartment
OCID.


Optional Parameters
===================

--access-level [text]

Valid values are RESTRICTED and ACCESSIBLE. Default is RESTRICTED.
Setting this to ACCESSIBLE returns only those compartments for which
the user has INSPECT permissions directly or indirectly (permissions
can be on a resource in a subcompartment). When set to RESTRICTED
permissions are checked and no partial results are displayed.

Accepted values are:

   ACCESSIBLE, RESTRICTED

--all

Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you
cannot provide the "--limit" option.

--compartment-id-in-subtree [boolean]

Default is false. When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is
traversed and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are
returned. Depends on the ‘accessLevel’ setting.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--limit [integer]

For details about how pagination works, see List Pagination.

--page [text]

It is usually retrieved from a previous “List” call. For details about
how pagination works, see List Pagination.

--page-size [integer]

When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only
valid when used with "--all" or "--limit", and ignored otherwise.

--scim-query [text]

The scimQuery query parameter accepts filter expressions that use the
syntax described in Section 3.2.2.2 of the System for Cross-Domain
Identity Management (SCIM) specification, which is available at
RFC3339. In SCIM filtering expressions, text, date, and time values
must be enclosed in quotation marks, with date and time values using
ISO-8601 format. (Numeric and boolean values should not be quoted.)

**Example:** (operationTime ge “2021-06-04T01-00-26”) and (eventName
eq “LOGON”) The attrExp or the field (for example, operationTime and
eventName in above example) which is used to filter can be any of the
fields returned by AuditEventSummary. adminUser, commonUser,
sensitiveActivity, dsActivity can only have eq operation and value 1.
These define admin user activity, common user activity, sensitive data
activity and data safe activity **Example:** (adminUser eq 1)

--sort-by [text]

If this query parameter is specified, the result is sorted by this
query parameter value.

Accepted values are:

   actionTaken, auditEventTime, auditLocation, auditPolicies, auditType, clientHostname, clientId, clientIp, clientProgram, commandParam, commandText, databaseType, dbUserName, errorCode, errorMessage, eventName, extendedEventAttributes, isAlerted, objectName, objectOwner, objectType, operation, operationStatus, osTerminal, osUserName, targetClass, targetName, timeCollected

--sort-order [text]

The sort order to use, either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC).

Accepted values are:

   ASC, DESC

Example using required parameter
================================

Copy the following CLI commands into a file named example.sh. Run the
command by typing “bash example.sh” and replacing the example
parameters with your own.

Please note this sample will only work in the POSIX-compliant bash-
like shell. You need to set up the OCI configuration and appropriate
security policies before trying the examples.
