work-request
************


Description
===========

The API operations used to create and configure Data Integration
resources do not take effect immediately. In these cases, the
operation spawns an asynchronous workflow to fulfill the request. Work
requests provide visibility into the status of these in-progress,
long-running asynchronous workflows.


Available Commands
==================

* get

* list

* list-work-request-errors

* list-work-request-logs
