auth-token
**********


Description
===========

An *AuthToken* is an Oracle-generated token string that you can use to
authenticate with third-party APIs that do not support Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure’s signature-based authentication. For example, use an
*AuthToken* to authenticate with a Swift client with the Object
Storage Service.

The auth token is associated with the user’s Console login. Auth
tokens never expire. A user can have up to two auth tokens at a time.

**Note:** The token is always an Oracle-generated string; you can’t
change it to a string of your choice.

For more information, see Managing User Credentials.
