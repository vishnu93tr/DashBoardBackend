replication
***********


Description
===========

Replications are the primary resource that governs the policy of
cross-region replication between source and target file systems.
Replications are associated with a secondary resource called a
>>``<<ReplicationTarget` <https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas
/latest/ReplicationTarget>`__ located in another availability domain
in the same or different region. The replication retrieves the delta
of data between two snapshots of a source file system and sends it to
the associated *ReplicationTarget*, which applies it to the target
file system. For more information, see File System Replication.
