Description
===========

A remote direct memory access (RDMA) network group.

A cluster network on a compute cluster is a group of high performance
computing (HPC), GPU, or optimized instances that are connected with
an ultra low-latency network.

Use compute clusters when you want to manage instances in the cluster
individually in the RDMA network group.

For details about cluster networks that use instance pools to manage
groups of identical instances, see ClusterNetwork.
