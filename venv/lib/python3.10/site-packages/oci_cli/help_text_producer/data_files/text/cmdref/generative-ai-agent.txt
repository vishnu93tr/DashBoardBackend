Description
===========

OCI Generative AI Agents is a fully managed service that combines the
power of large language models (LLMs) with an intelligent retrieval
system to create contextually relevant answers by searching your
knowledge base, making your AI applications smart and efficient.

OCI Generative AI Agents supports several ways to onboard your data
and then allows you and your customers to interact with your data
using a chat interface or CLI.

Use the Generative AI Agents CLI to create and manage agents,
knowledge bases, data sources, endpoints, data ingestion jobs, and
work requests.

For creating and managing client chat sessions see the [Generative AI
Agents Client CLI].

To learn more about the service, see the Generative AI Agents
documentation.
