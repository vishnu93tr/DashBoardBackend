Description
===========

Tests a data processing operation on the provided input, returning the
potentially modified input as output. Returns 200 on success, 422 when
the input can not be processed.


Usage
=====

   oci apm-config test span-enrichment-group [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--apm-domain-id [text]

The APM Domain ID the request is intended for.

--options [complex type]

The span enrichment rules to test in the format of an Options
resource. This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The
value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as
a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--span [complex type]

The span to test the rules on. This should be a valid JSON object that
follows one of the formats used by distributed tracing frameworks,
such as OpenTelemetry, Zipkin, or Oracle Application Performance
Monitoring. This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The
value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as
a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.


Optional Parameters
===================

--filters [complex type]

A list of filters to try against the given span.

This option is a JSON list with items of type FilterTextOrId.  For
documentation on FilterTextOrId please see our API reference: https:/
/docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/config/20210201/datatypes/FilterTextO
rId. This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value
can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

Example using required parameter
================================

Copy and paste the following example into a JSON file, replacing the
example parameters with your own.

       oci apm-config test span-enrichment-group --generate-param-json-input options > options.json
       oci apm-config test span-enrichment-group --generate-param-json-input span > span.json

Copy the following CLI commands into a file named example.sh. Run the
command by typing “bash example.sh” and replacing the example
parameters with your own.

Please note this sample will only work in the POSIX-compliant bash-
like shell. You need to set up the OCI configuration and appropriate
security policies before trying the examples.
