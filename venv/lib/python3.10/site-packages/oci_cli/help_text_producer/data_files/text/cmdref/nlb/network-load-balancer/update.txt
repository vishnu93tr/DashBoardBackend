Description

Updates the network load balancer


Usage
=====

   oci nlb network-load-balancer update [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--network-load-balancer-id [text]

The OCID of the network load balancer to update.


Optional Parameters
===================

--assigned-ipv6 [text]

IPv6 address to be assigned to the network load balancer being
created. This IP address has to be part of one of the prefixes
supported by the subnet. Example:
“2607:9b80:9a0a:9a7e:abcd:ef01:2345:6789”

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--display-name [text]

The user-friendly display name for the network load balancer, which
does not have to be unique and can be changed. Avoid entering
confidential information.

Example:

   example_network_load_balancer

--force

Perform update without prompting for confirmation.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource. The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the current
etag value of the resource.

--is-preserve-source-destination [boolean]

This parameter can be enabled only if backends are compute OCIDs. When
enabled, the skipSourceDestinationCheck parameter is automatically
enabled on the load balancer VNIC, and packets are sent to the backend
with the entire IP header intact.

--is-symmetric-hash-enabled [boolean]

This can only be enabled when NLB is working in transparent mode with
source destination header preservation enabled. This removes the
additional dependency from NLB backends(like Firewalls) to perform
SNAT.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--nlb-ip-version [text]

IP version associated with the NLB.

Accepted values are:

   IPV4, IPV4_AND_IPV6, IPV6

--security-attributes [complex type]

ZPR tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with
no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"oracle-zpr": {"td": {"value": "42", "mode": "audit"}}}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--subnet-ipv6-cidr [text]

IPv6 subnet prefix selection. If Ipv6 subnet prefix is passed, Nlb
Ipv6 Address would be assign within the cidr block. NLB has to be dual
or single stack ipv6 to support this.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource
and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation.
Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work
request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified,
returning on the first state. For example, "--wait-for-state"
SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on whichever
lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code
of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACCEPTED, CANCELED, CANCELING, FAILED, IN_PROGRESS, SUCCEEDED

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the work request
has reached the state defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 30
seconds.
