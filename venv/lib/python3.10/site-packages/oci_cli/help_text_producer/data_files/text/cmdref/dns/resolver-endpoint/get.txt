Description
===========

Gets information about a specific resolver endpoint.

Note that attempting to get a resolver endpoint in the DELETED
lifecycle state will result in a *404* response to be consistent with
other operations of the API.


Usage
=====

   oci dns resolver-endpoint get [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--resolver-endpoint-name [text]

The name of the target resolver endpoint.

--resolver-id [text]

The OCID of the target resolver.


Optional Parameters
===================

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-modified-since [text]

The *If-Modified-Since* header field makes a GET or HEAD request
method conditional on the selected representation’s modification date
being more recent than the date provided in the field-value.  Transfer
of the selected representation’s data is avoided if that data has not
changed.

--if-none-match [text]

The *If-None-Match* header field makes the request method conditional
on the absence of any current representation of the target resource,
when the field-value is ***, or having a selected representation with
an entity-tag that does not match any of those listed in the field-
value.

--scope [text]

Specifies to operate only on resources that have a matching DNS scope.

Accepted values are:

   GLOBAL, PRIVATE


Global Parameters

Example using required parameter
================================

Copy the following CLI commands into a file named example.sh. Run the
command by typing “bash example.sh” and replacing the example
parameters with your own.

Please note this sample will only work in the POSIX-compliant bash-
like shell. You need to set up the OCI configuration and appropriate
security policies before trying the examples.
