Description
===========

Aggregation entities are required by the API consistency guidelines
for API Consistency Guidelines#AnalyticsAPIs.  These are used to
summarize annotations for a given dataset and will be used to populate
UI elements.  Aggregations need to have the fields that identify the
exact scope that theyâ€™re summarizing.  Any filters applied to the list
API, have to show up in the aggregation.
