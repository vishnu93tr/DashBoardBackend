Description
===========

A *network security group* (NSG) provides virtual firewall rules for a
specific set of VNICs in a VCN. Compare NSGs with SecurityLists, which
provide virtual firewall rules to all the VNICs in a *subnet*.

A network security group consists of two items:

   * The set of VNICs that all have the same security rule needs (for
     example, a group of Compute instances all running the same
     application)   * A set of NSG SecurityRules that apply to the
     VNICs in the group

After creating an NSG, you can add VNICs and security rules to it. For
example, when you create an instance, you can specify one or more NSGs
to add the instance to (see CreateVnicDetails). Or you can add an
existing instance to an NSG with UpdateVnic.

To add security rules to an NSG, see
AddNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRules.

To list the VNICs in an NSG, see ListNetworkSecurityGroupVnics.

To list the security rules in an NSG, see
ListNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRules.

For more information about network security groups, see Network
Security Groups.

**Important:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute service images
automatically include firewall rules (for example, Linux iptables,
Windows firewall). If there are issues with some type of access to an
instance, make sure all of the following are set correctly:

   * Any security rules in any NSGs the instance’s VNIC belongs to   *
     Any SecurityLists associated with the instance’s subnet   * The
     instance’s OS firewall rules

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
