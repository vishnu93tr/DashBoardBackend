Description
===========

Gets the Managed Database for a specific ID or the list of Managed
Databases in a specific compartment. Managed Databases can be filtered
based on the name parameter. Only one of the parameters, ID or name
should be provided. If neither of these parameters is provided, all
the Managed Databases in the compartment are listed. Managed Databases
can also be filtered based on the deployment type and management
option. If the deployment type is not specified or if it is
*ONPREMISE*, then the management option is not considered and Managed
Databases with *ADVANCED* management option are listed.


Usage
=====

   oci database-management managed-database list [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment.


Optional Parameters
===================

--all

Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you
cannot provide the "--limit" option.

--deployment-type [text]

A filter to return Managed Databases of the specified deployment type.

Accepted values are:

   AUTONOMOUS, BM, EXADATA, EXADATA_CC, EXADATA_XS, ONPREMISE, VM

--external-exadata-infrastructure-id [text]

The OCID of the Exadata infrastructure.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only
