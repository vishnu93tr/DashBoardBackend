delegated-resource-access-request
*********************************


Description
===========

A support operator raises Delegated Resource Access Request when they
need access to any infrastructure resource governed by Delegation
Control. The Delegated Resource Access Request identifies the target
resource and the set of Service Provider Actions. Delegated Resource
Access Request handling depends upon the Delegation Control that
governs the target resource, and the set of Service Provider Actions
listed for approval in the Delegated Resource Access Request. If all
of the Service Provider Actions listed in the Delegated Resource
Access Request are in the pre-approved list in the Delegation Control
that governs the target resource, then the Delegated Resource Access
Request is automatically approved. If not, then the Delegated Resource
Access Request requires explicit approval from the approver group
specified by the Delegation Control governing the target resource.

You can approve or reject a Delegated Resource Access Request. You can
also revoke the approval of an already approved Delegated Resource
Access Request. While creating a Delegated Resource Access Request,
the support operator specifies the duration of access. You have the
option to approve the entire duration or reduce or even increase the
time duration. A support operator can also request for an extension.
The approval for such an extension is processed the same way the
original Delegated Resource Access Request was processed.
