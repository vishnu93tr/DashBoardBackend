work-request

Description
===========

An asynchronous work request. Work requests help you monitor long-
running operations. When you start a long-running operation, the
service creates a work request. A work request is an activity log that
lets you track each step in the operationâ€™s progress. Each work
request has an OCID that lets you interact with it programmatically
and use it for automation.
