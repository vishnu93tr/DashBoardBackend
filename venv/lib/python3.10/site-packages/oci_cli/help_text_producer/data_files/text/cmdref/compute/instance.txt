instance
********


Description
===========

A compute host. The image used to launch the instance determines its
operating system and other software. The shape specified during the
launch process determines the number of CPUs and memory allocated to
the instance.

When you launch an instance, it is automatically attached to a virtual
network interface card (VNIC), called the *primary VNIC*. The VNIC has
a private IP address from the subnet’s CIDR. You can either assign a
private IP address of your choice or let Oracle automatically assign
one. You can choose whether the instance has a public IP address. To
retrieve the addresses, use the ListVnicAttachments operation to get
the VNIC ID for the instance, and then call GetVnic with the VNIC ID.

For more information, see Overview of the Compute Service.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
