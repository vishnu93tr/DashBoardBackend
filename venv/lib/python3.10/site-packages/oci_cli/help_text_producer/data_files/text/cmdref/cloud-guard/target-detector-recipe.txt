**********************


Description
===========

A TargetDetectorRecipe resource contains a specific instance of one of
the supported detector types (for example, activity, configuration, or
threat) in which some settings can be modified specifically for a
single target.

A TargetDetectorRecipe resource: * Is effectively a copy of a
DetectorRecipe resource in which users can make very limited changes
if it’s Oracle-managed, and more changes if it’s user-managed. * Is
visible on the Cloud Guard Targets, Target Details page. * Is located
in a specific OCI compartment. * Can be modified by users,
programmatically or through the UI. * Changes that can be made here
override any settings in the corresponding DetectorRecipe, of which
the TargetDetectorRecipe resource is effectively a copy, created when
the detector recipe is attached to the target.
