Description
===========

Use the Identity Domains CLI to manage resources within an identity
domain, for example, users, dynamic resource groups, groups, and
identity providers. For information about managing resources within
identity domains, see Identity and Access Management (with identity
domains). Use this pattern to construct endpoints for identity
domains: *https://<domainURL>/admin/v1/*. See Finding an Identity
Domain URL to locate the domain URL you need. Use the table of
contents and search tool to explore the Identity Domains CLI.
