Description

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) credentials are needed to send
email through Email Delivery. The SMTP credentials are used for SMTP
authentication with the service. The credentials never expire. A user
can have up to 2 SMTP credentials at a time.

**Note:** The credential set is always an Oracle-generated SMTP user
name and password pair; you cannot designate the SMTP user name or the
SMTP password.
