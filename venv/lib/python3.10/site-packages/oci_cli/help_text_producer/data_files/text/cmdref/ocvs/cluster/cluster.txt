cluster
*******


Description
===========

An Oracle Cloud VMware Solution Cluster contains the resources
required for a functional VMware environment. Instances in a Cluster
(see EsxiHost) run in a virtual cloud network (VCN) and are
preconfigured with VMware and storage. Use the vCenter utility to
manage and deploy VMware virtual machines (VMs) in the Cluster.

The Cluster uses a single management subnet for provisioning the
Cluster. It also uses a set of VLANs for various components of the
VMware environment (vSphere, vMotion, vSAN, and so on). See the Core
Services API for information about VCN subnets and VLANs.
