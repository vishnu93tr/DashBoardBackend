"change-database-parameters"
****************************

* Description

* Usage

* Required Parameters

* Optional Parameters

* Global Parameters


Description
===========

Changes database parameter values. There are two kinds of database
parameters:

* Dynamic parameters: They can be changed for the current Oracle
  Database instance. The changes take effect immediately. - Static
  parameters: They cannot be changed for the current instance. You
  must change these parameters and then restart the database before
  changes take effect.

**Note:** If the instance is started using a text initialization
parameter file, the parameter changes are applicable only for the
current instance. You must update them manually to be passed to a
future instance.


Usage
=====

   oci database-management managed-database change-database-parameters [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--managed-database-id [text]

The OCID of the Managed Database.

--parameters [complex type]

A list of database parameters and their values. This is a complex type
whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string
on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--scope [text]

The clause used to specify when the parameter change takes effect.

Use *MEMORY* to make the change in memory and affect it immediately.
Use *SPFILE* to make the change in the server parameter file. The
change takes effect when the database is next shut down and started up
again. Use *BOTH* to make the change in memory and in the server
parameter file. The change takes effect immediately and persists after
the database is shut down and started up again.

Accepted values are:

   BOTH, MEMORY, SPFILE


Optional Parameters
===================

--credentials [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--database-credential [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
