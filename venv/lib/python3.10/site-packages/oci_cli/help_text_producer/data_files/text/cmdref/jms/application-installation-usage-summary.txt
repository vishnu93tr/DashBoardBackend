application-installation-usage-summary
**************************************


Description
===========

Summarizes application installation usage information during a
specified time period. The main difference between ApplicationUsage
and ApplicationInstallationUsageSummary is the presence of
installation information. ApplicationUsage provides only aggregated
information for an application regardless of the installation paths.
Therefore, two different applications with the same application name
installed in two different paths will be aggregated to a single
application. This aggregation makes it difficult to focus actions to
single application installed on a known path. An application
installation is independent of the Java Runtime on which it’s running
or the Managed Instance where it’s installed.
