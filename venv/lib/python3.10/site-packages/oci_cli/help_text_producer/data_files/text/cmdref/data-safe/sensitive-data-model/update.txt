Description
===========

Updates one or more attributes of the specified sensitive data model.
Note that updating any attribute of a sensitive data model does not
perform data discovery.


Usage
=====

   oci data-safe sensitive-data-model update [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--sensitive-data-model-id [text]

The OCID of the sensitive data model.


Optional Parameters
===================

--app-suite-name [text]

The application suite name identifying a collection of applications.
It’s useful only if maintaining a sensitive data model for a suite of
applications.

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags Example:
*{“Operations”: {“CostCenter”: “42”}}* This is a complex type whose
value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the
command line or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file
syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--description [text]

The description of the sensitive data model.

--display-name [text]

The display name of the sensitive data model. The name does not have
to be unique, and it’s changeable.

--force

Perform update without prompting for confirmation.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags

Example:

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the if-match parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource. The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource’s
current etag value.

--is-app-defined-relation-discovery-enabled [boolean]

Indicates if data discovery jobs should identify potential
application-level (non-dictionary) referential relationships between
columns. Note that data discovery automatically identifies and adds
database-level (dictionary-defined) relationships. This option helps
identify application-level relationships that are not defined in the
database dictionary, which in turn, helps identify additional
sensitive columns and preserve referential integrity during data
masking. It’s disabled by default and should be used only if there is
a need to identify application-level relationships.

--is-sample-data-collection-enabled [boolean]

Indicates if data discovery jobs should collect and store sample data
values for the discovered columns. Sample data helps review the
discovered columns and ensure that they actually contain sensitive
data. As it collects original data from the target database, it’s
disabled by default and should be used only if it’s acceptable to
store sample data in Data Safe’s repository in Oracle Cloud. Note that
sample data values are not collected for columns with the following
data types: LONG, LOB, RAW, XMLTYPE and BFILE.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--schemas-for-discovery [complex type]

The schemas to be used for future data discovery jobs. This is a
complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided
as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--sensitive-type-group-ids-for-discovery [complex type]

The OCIDs of the sensitive type groups to be used by data discovery
jobs. This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value
can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--sensitive-type-ids-for-discovery [complex type]

The OCIDs of the sensitive types to be used for future data discovery
jobs. If OCID of a sensitive category is provided, all its child
sensitive types are used for data discovery. This is a complex type
whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string
on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--tables-for-discovery [complex type]

The data discovery jobs will scan the tables specified here, including
both schemas and tables. For instance, the input could be in the
format: [{schemaName: “HR”, tableName: [“T1”, “T2”]}, {schemaName:
“OE”, tableName : [“T3”, “T4”]}].

This option is a JSON list with items of type TablesForDiscovery.  For
documentation on TablesForDiscovery please see our API reference: htt
ps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/datasafe/20181201/datatypes/Table
sForDiscovery. This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON.
The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in
as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--target-id [text]

The OCID of the reference target database to be associated with the
sensitive data model. All operations such as performing data discovery
and adding columns manually are done in the context of the associated
target database. Note that updating the targetId attribute does not
perform data discovery automatically.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource
and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation.
Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work
request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified,
returning on the first state. For example, "--wait-for-state"
SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on whichever
lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code
of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACCEPTED, CANCELED, CANCELING, FAILED, IN_PROGRESS, SUCCEEDED, SUSPENDED, SUSPENDING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the work request
has reached the state defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 30
seconds.
