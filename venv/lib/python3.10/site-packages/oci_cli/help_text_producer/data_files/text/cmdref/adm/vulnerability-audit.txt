vulnerability-audit
*******************


Description
===========

A vulnerability audit associates the application dependencies of a
project with their associated Vulnerabilities. Each Vulnerability is
associated with a score (Common Vulnerability Scoring System V2 or
V3). A vulnerable application dependency can be ignored based on the
configuration of the vulnerability audit. maxObservedCvssV2Score,
maxObservedCvssV3Score and vulnerableArtifactsCount do not take into
account non-vulnerable application dependency.
