--credentials [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--shape [text]

The name of the shape for the database instance node. Use the /shapes
API for accepted shapes. Example: *VM.Standard.E4.Flex*

--storage-details [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. Example: *{“foo-namespace”: {“bar-key”: “value”}}* This is
a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be
provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte

Example using required parameter
================================

Copy and paste the following example into a JSON file, replacing the
example parameters with your own.

       oci psql db-system create --generate-param-json-input credentials > credentials.json
       oci psql db-system create --generate-param-json-input network-details > network-details.json
       oci psql db-system create --generate-param-json-input storage-details > storage-details.json

Copy the following CLI commands into a file named example.sh. Run the
command by typing “bash example.sh” and replacing the example
parameters with your own.

Please note this sample will only work in the POSIX-compliant bash-
like shell. You need to set up the OCI configuration and appropriate
security policies before trying the examples.
