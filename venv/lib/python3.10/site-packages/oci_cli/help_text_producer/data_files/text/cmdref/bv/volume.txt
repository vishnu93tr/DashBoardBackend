Description
===========

A detachable block volume device that allows you to dynamically expand
the storage capacity of an instance. For more information, see
Overview of Cloud Volume Storage.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
