Description
===========

A resource to be used only with the Oracle Cloud VMware Solution.

Conceptually, a virtual LAN (VLAN) is a broadcast domain that is
created by partitioning and isolating a network at the data link layer
(a *layer 2 network*). VLANs work by using IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tags.
Layer 2 traffic is forwarded within the VLAN based on MAC learning.

In the Networking service, a VLAN is an object within a VCN. You use
VLANs to partition the VCN at the data link layer (layer 2). A VLAN is
analagous to a subnet, which is an object for partitioning the VCN at
the IP layer (layer 3).
