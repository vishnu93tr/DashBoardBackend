bucket
******


Description
===========

A bucket is a container for storing objects in a compartment within a
namespace. A bucket is associated with a single compartment. The
compartment has policies that indicate what actions a user can perform
on a bucket and all the objects in the bucket. For more information,
see Managing Buckets.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you are not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you
are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access,
see Getting Started with Policies.
