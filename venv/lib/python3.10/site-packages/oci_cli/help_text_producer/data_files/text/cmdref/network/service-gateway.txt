service-gateway
***************


Description
===========

Represents a router that lets your VCN privately access specific
Oracle services such as Object Storage without exposing the VCN to the
public internet. Traffic leaving the VCN and destined for a supported
Oracle service (use the ListServices operation to find available
service CIDR labels) is routed through the service gateway and does
not traverse the internet. The instances in the VCN do not need to
have public IP addresses nor be in a public subnet. The VCN does not
need an internet gateway for this traffic. For more information, see
Access to Oracle Services: Service Gateway.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
