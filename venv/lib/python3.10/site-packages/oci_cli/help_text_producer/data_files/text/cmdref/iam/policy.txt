policy
******


Description
===========

A document that specifies the type of access a group has to the
resources in a compartment. For information about policies and other
IAM Service components, see Overview of IAM. If you’re new to
policies, see Get Started with Policies.

The word “policy” is used by people in different ways:

   * An individual statement written in the policy language   * A
     collection of statements in a single, named “policy” document
     (which has an Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) assigned to it)   * The
     overall body of policies your organization uses to control access
     to resources

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
