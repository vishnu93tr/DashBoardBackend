that representation. Duplicate values MUST NOT be included. Value
order is not specified and MUST not impact behavior.

Resource with its own identifier, obviating the need to store a local
mapping between the local identifier of the Resource and the
identifier used by the Service Provider. Each Resource MAY include a
non-empty externalId value. The value of the externalId attribute is
always issued by the Service Consumer and can never be specified by
the Service Provider. The Service Provider MUST always interpret the
externalId as scoped to the Service Consumer’s tenant.

(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
