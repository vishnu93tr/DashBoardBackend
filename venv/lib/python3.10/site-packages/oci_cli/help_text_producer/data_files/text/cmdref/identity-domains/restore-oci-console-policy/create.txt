   oci identity-domains restore-oci-console-policy create [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--consent [boolean]

**SCIM++ Properties:** - idcsSearchable: false - multiValued: false -
required: true - mutability: writeOnly - returned: default - type:
boolean Consent to be provided for restoring the Oci Console SignOn
Policy to Factory Defaults. Defaults to false

--reason [text]

**SCIM++ Properties:** - idcsSearchable: false - multiValued: false -
mutability: writeOnly - required: true - returned: default - type:
string Detailed reason when domain admin opts to restore the Oci
Console SignOn Policy to Factory Defaults

--schemas [complex type]

**SCIM++ Properties:** - caseExact: false - idcsSearchable: false -
multiValued: true - mutability: readWrite - required: true - returned:
default - type: string - uniqueness: none REQUIRED. The schemas
attribute is an array of Strings which allows introspection of the
supported schema version for a SCIM representation as well any schema
extensions supported by that representation. Each String value must be
a unique URI. This specification defines URIs for User, Group, and a
standard “enterprise” extension. All representations of SCIM schema
MUST include a non-zero value array with value(s) of the URIs
supported by that representation. Duplicate values MUST NOT be
included. Value order is not specified and MUST not impact behavior.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.


Optional Parameters
===================

--authorization [text]

The Authorization field value consists of credentials containing the
authentication information of the user agent for the realm of the
resource being requested.

--compartment-ocid [text]

**SCIM++ Properties:** - caseExact: false - idcsSearchable: false -
multiValued: false - mutability: readOnly - required: false -
returned: default - type: string - uniqueness: none OCI Compartment Id
(ocid) in which the resource lives.

--delete-in-progress [boolean]

**SCIM++ Properties:** - caseExact: false - idcsSearchable: true -
multiValued: false - mutability: readOnly - required: false -
returned: default - type: boolean - uniqueness: none A boolean flag
indicating this resource in the process of being deleted. Usually set
to true when synchronous deletion of the resource would take too long.

--domain-ocid [text]

**SCIM++ Properties:** - caseExact: false - idcsSearchable: false -
multiValued: false - mutability: readOnly - required: false -
returned: default - type: string - uniqueness: none OCI Domain Id

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
