resolver
********


Description
===========

An OCI DNS resolver. If the resolver has an attached VCN, the VCN will
attempt to answer queries based on the attached views in priority
order. If the query does not match any of the attached views, the
query will be evaluated against the default view. If the default view
does not match, the rules will be evaluated in priority order. If no
rules match the query, answers come from Internet DNS. A resolver may
have a maximum of 10 resolver endpoints.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
