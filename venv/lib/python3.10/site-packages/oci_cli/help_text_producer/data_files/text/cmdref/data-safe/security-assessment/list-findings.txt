Description
===========

List all the findings from all the targets in the specified
compartment.


Usage
=====

   oci data-safe security-assessment list-findings [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--security-assessment-id [text]

The OCID of the security assessment.


Optional Parameters
===================

--access-level [text]

Valid values are RESTRICTED and ACCESSIBLE. Default is RESTRICTED.
Setting this to ACCESSIBLE returns only those compartments for which
the user has INSPECT permissions directly or indirectly (permissions
can be on a resource in a subcompartment). When set to RESTRICTED
permissions are checked and no partial results are displayed.

Accepted values are:

   ACCESSIBLE, RESTRICTED

--all

Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you
cannot provide the "--limit" option.

--compartment-id-in-subtree [boolean]

Default is false. When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is
traversed and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are
returned. Depends on the ‘accessLevel’ setting.

--field [text]

Specifies a subset of fields to be returned in the response.

Accepted values are:

   category, details, findingKey, isRiskModified, isTopFinding, reference, remarks, severity, summary, targetId, title

--finding-key [text]

Each finding in security assessment has an associated key (think of
key as a finding’s name). For a given finding, the key will be the
same across targets. The user can use these keys to filter the
findings.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--is-top-finding [boolean]

A filter to return only the findings that are marked as top findings.

--lifecycle-state [text]

A filter to return only the findings that match the specified
lifecycle states.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, FAILED, NEEDS_ATTENTION, UPDATING

--limit [integer]

For list pagination. The maximum number of items to return per page in
a paginated “List” call. For details about how pagination works, see
List Pagination.

--page [text]

For list pagination. The page token representing the page at which to
start retrieving results. It is usually retrieved from a previous
“List” call. For details about how pagination works, see List
Pagination.

--page-size [integer]

When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only
valid when used with "--all" or "--limit", and ignored otherwise.

--references [text]

An optional filter to return only findings that match the specified
reference.

Accepted values are:

   CIS, GDPR, STIG

--scim-query [text]

The scimQuery query parameter accepts filter expressions that use the
syntax described in Section 3.2.2.2 of the System for Cross-Domain
Identity Management (SCIM) specification, which is available at
RFC3339. In SCIM filtering expressions, text, date, and time values
must be enclosed in quotation marks, with date and time values using
ISO-8601 format. (Numeric and boolean values should not be quoted.)

**Example:** | scimQuery=(severity eq ‘high’) and (targetId eq
‘target_1’) scimQuery=(category eq “Users”) and (targetId eq
“target_1”) scimQuery=(reference eq ‘CIS’) and (targetId eq
‘target_1’)

Supported fields: severity findingKey reference targetId isTopFinding
title category remarks details summary isRiskModified

--severity [text]

A filter to return only findings of a particular risk level.

Accepted values are:

   ADVISORY, DEFERRED, EVALUATE, HIGH, LOW, MEDIUM, PASS

--sort-by [text]

The field to sort by. You can specify only one sort order(sortOrder).
The default order for category is alphabetical.

Accepted values are:

   category, findingKey, severity

--target-id [text]

A filter to return only items related to a specific target OCID.

Example using required parameter
================================

Copy the following CLI commands into a file named example.sh. Run the
command by typing “bash example.sh” and replacing the example
parameters with your own.

Please note this sample will only work in the POSIX-compliant bash-
like shell. You need to set up the OCI configuration and appropriate
security policies before trying the examples.
