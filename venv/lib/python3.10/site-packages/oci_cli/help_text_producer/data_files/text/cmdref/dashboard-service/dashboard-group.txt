Description
===========

Use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Dashboards service CLI to manage
dashboards in the Console. Dashboards provide an organized and
customizable view of resources and their metrics in the Console. For
more information, see Dashboards.

**Important:** Resources for the Dashboards service are created in the
tenacy’s home region. Although it is possible to create dashboard and
dashboard group resources in regions other than the home region, you
won’t be able to view those resources in the Console. Therefore,
creating resources outside of the home region is not recommended.
