Description
===========

A TargetResponderRecipe resource contains a specific instance of one
of the supported detector types (for example, activity, configuration,
or threat) in which some settings can be modified specifically for a
single target.

A TargetResponderRecipe resource: * Is effectively a copy of a
ResponderRecipe resource in which users can make very limited changes
if it’s Oracle-managed, and more changes if it’s user-managed. * Is
visible on the Cloud Guard Targets, Target Details page. * Is located
in a specific OCI compartment. * Can be modified by users,
programmatically or through the UI. * Changes that can be made here
override any settings in the corresponding ResponderRecipe, of which
the TargetResponderRecipe resource is effectively a copy of the
ResponderRecipe resource (effectively created when the detector recipe
is attached to the target).
