* Example using required parameter


Description
===========

Creates a new DB system in the specified compartment and availability
domain. The Oracle Database edition that you specify applies to all
the databases on that DB system. The selected edition cannot be
changed.

An initial database is created on the DB system based on the request
parameters you provide and some default options. For detailed
information about default options, see Bare metal and virtual machine
DB system default options.

**Note:** Deprecated for Exadata Cloud Service systems. Use the new
resource model APIs instead.

For Exadata Cloud Service instances, support for this API will end on
May 15th, 2021. See Switching an Exadata DB System to the New Resource
Model and APIs for details on converting existing Exadata DB systems
to the new resource model.

Use the CreateCloudExadataInfrastructure and CreateCloudVmCluster APIs
to provision a new Exadata Cloud Service instance.

The OCID of the compartment the DB system  belongs in.

--cpu-core-count [integer]

The number of CPU cores to enable for a bare metal or Exadata DB
system or AMD VMDB Systems. The valid values depend on the specified
shape:

* BM.DenseIO1.36 - Specify a multiple of 2, from 2 to 36. -

  Exadata.Full2.368 - Specify a multiple of 8, from 0 to 368. -
  VM.Standard.E4.Flex - Specify any thing from 1 to 64.

This parameter is not used for INTEL virtual machine DB systems
because virtual machine DB systems have a set number of cores for each
shape. For information about the number of cores for a virtual machine
DB system shape, see Virtual Machine DB Systems

--database-edition [text]

The Oracle Database Edition that applies to all the databases on the
DB system. Exadata DB systems and 2-node RAC DB systems require
ENTERPRISE_EDITION_EXTREME_PERFORMANCE.

Accepted values are:

   ENTERPRISE_EDITION, ENTERPRISE_EDITION_EXTREME_PERFORMANCE, ENTERPRISE_EDITION_HIGH_PERFORMANCE, STANDARD_EDITION

--db-name [text]

The database name. It must begin with an alphabetic character and can
contain a maximum of eight alphanumeric characters. Special characters
are not permitted.

--db-version [text]

A valid Oracle database version. To get a list of supported versions,
use the command ‘oci db version list’.

--hostname [text]

The hostname for the DB system. The hostname must begin with an
alphabetic character, and can contain alphanumeric characters and
hyphens (-). The maximum length of the hostname is 16 characters for
bare metal and virtual machine DB systems, and 12 characters for
Exadata DB systems.

The maximum length of the combined hostname and domain is 63
characters.

**Note:** The hostname must be unique within the subnet. If it is not
unique, the DB system will fail to provision.

--shape [text]

The shape of the DB system. The shape determines resources allocated
to the DB system. - For virtual machine shapes, the number of CPU
cores and memory - For bare metal and Exadata shapes, the number of
CPU cores, memory, and storage

To get a list of shapes, use the ListDbSystemShapes operation.

--ssh-authorized-keys-file [filename]

the DB System. Use a newline character to separate multiple keys. The
length of the combined keys cannot exceed 10,000 characters.

--subnet-id [text]

The OCID of the subnet the DB system is associated with.

**Subnet Restrictions:** - For bare metal DB systems and for single
node virtual machine DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps
with 192.168.16.16/28. - For Exadata and virtual machine 2-node RAC DB
systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20.

These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect
on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause
the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to
both the client subnet and the backup subnet.

identical to the database name or prefixed by the datbase name and
followed by an underscore.

--db-workload [text]

Database workload type. Allowed values are: OLTP, DSS

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags. This is a complex
type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
string on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--disk-redundancy [text]

redundancy, recommended for test and development systems. High is
3-way redundancy, recommended for production systems.

Accepted values are:

   HIGH, NORMAL

--display-name [text]

The user-friendly name for the DB system. The name does not have to be
unique.

--domain [text]

A domain name used for the DB system. If the Oracle-provided Internet
and VCN Resolver is enabled for the specified subnet, the domain name
for the subnet is used (do not provide one). Otherwise, provide a
valid DNS domain name. Hyphens (-) are not permitted.

--fault-domains [complex type]

A Fault Domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an
availability domain. Fault Domains let you distribute your instances
so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single
availability domain. A hardware failure or maintenance that affects
one Fault Domain does not affect DB systems in other Fault Domains.

If you do not specify the Fault Domain, the system selects one for
you. To change the Fault Domain for a DB system, terminate it and
launch a new DB system in the preferred Fault Domain.

If the node count is greater than 1, you can specify which Fault
Domains these nodes will be distributed into. The system assigns your
nodes automatically to the Fault Domains you specify so that no Fault
Domain contains more than one node.

To get a list of Fault Domains, use the ListFaultDomains operation in
the Identity and Access Management Service API.

Example:

   FAULT-DOMAIN-1

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
