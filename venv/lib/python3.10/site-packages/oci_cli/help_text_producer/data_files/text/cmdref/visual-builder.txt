Description
===========

Oracle Visual Builder enables developers to quickly build web and
mobile applications. With a visual development environment that makes
it easy to connect to Oracle data and third-party REST services,
developers can build modern, consumer-grade applications in a fraction
of the time it would take in other tools. The Visual Builder Instance
Management CLI allows users to create and manage a Visual Builder
instance.
