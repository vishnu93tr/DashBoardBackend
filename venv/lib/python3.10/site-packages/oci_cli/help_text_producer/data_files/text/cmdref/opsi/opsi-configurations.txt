Description
===========

An OPSI configuration resource is a container for storing custom
values for customizable configuration items exposed by Operations
Insights.

Operations Insights exposes different sets of customizable
configuration items through different OPSI configuration types.
UX_CONFIGURATION: OPSI configuration resource of this type can be
created only once in each compartment. It is a compartment level
singleton resource.

When configuration values, for an OPSI configuration type that
supports compartment level singleton (e.g: UX_CONFIGURATION) resource,
are queried for a compartment, following will be the order of
preference. 1. If the specified compartment has an OPSI configuration
resource, first preference will be given to the custom values inside
that. 2. If the root compartment has an OPSI configuration resource,
it will be considered as applicable to all compartments of that
tenency, hence second preference will be given to the custom values
inside that. 3. Default configuration will be considered as a final
fallback option.
