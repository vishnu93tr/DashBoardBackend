export
******


Description
===========

A file system and the path that you can use to mount it. Each export
resource belongs to exactly one export set.

The export’s path attribute is not a path in the referenced file
system, but the value used by clients for the path component of the
remotetarget argument when mounting the file system.

The path must start with a slash (/) followed by a sequence of zero or
more slash-separated path elements. For any two export resources
associated with the same export set, except those in a ‘DELETED’
state, the path element sequence for the first export resource can’t
contain the complete path element sequence of the second export
resource.

   For example, the following are acceptable:

      * /example and /path   * /example1 and /example2   * /example
        and /example1

The following examples are not acceptable:   * /example and
/example/path   * / and /example

Paths may not end in a slash (/). No path element can be a period (.)
or two periods in sequence (..). All path elements must be 255 bytes
or less.

No two non-‘DELETED’ export resources in the same export set can
reference the same file system.

Use *exportOptions* to control access to an export. For more
information, see Export Options.
