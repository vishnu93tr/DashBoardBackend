cpe
***


Description
===========

An object you create when setting up a Site-to-Site VPN between your
on-premises network and VCN. The *Cpe* is a virtual representation of
your customer-premises equipment, which is the actual router on-
premises at your site at your end of the Site-to-Site VPN IPSec
connection. For more information, see Overview of the Networking
Service.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
