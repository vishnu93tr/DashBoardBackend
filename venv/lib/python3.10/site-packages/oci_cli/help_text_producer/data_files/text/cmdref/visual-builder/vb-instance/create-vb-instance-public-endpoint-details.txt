Usage
=====

   oci visual-builder vb-instance create-vb-instance-public-endpoint-details [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

Compartment Identifier.

--display-name [text]

Vb Instance Identifier.

--node-count [integer]

The number of Nodes


Optional Parameters
===================

--alternate-custom-endpoints [complex type]

A list of alternate custom endpoints to be used for the vb instance
URL (contact Oracle for alternateCustomEndpoints availability for a
specific instance).

This option is a JSON list with items of type
CreateCustomEndpointDetails.  For documentation on
CreateCustomEndpointDetails please see our API reference: https://doc
s.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/vbinstance/20210601/datatypes/CreateCusto
mEndpointDetails. This is a complex type whose value must be valid
JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or
passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--consumption-model [text]

Optional parameter specifying which entitlement to use for billing
purposes. Only required if the account possesses more than one
entitlement.

Accepted values are:

   GOV, UCM, VB4SAAS

--custom-endpoint [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--defined-tags [complex type]

Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to
namespaces. Example: *{“foo-namespace”: {“bar-key”: “value”}}* This is
a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be
provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name,
type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: *{“bar-
key”: “value”}* This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON.
The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in
as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

Encrypted IDCS Open ID token. This is required for pre-UCPIS cloud
accounts, but not UCPIS, hence not a required parameter

--is-visual-builder-enabled [boolean]

Visual Builder is enabled or not.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

Source IP addresses or IP address ranges ingress rules. (ex:
“168.122.59.5/32”, “10.20.30.0/26”) An invalid IP or CIDR block will
result in a 400 response. This is a complex type whose value must be
valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line
or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--network-endpoint-details-allowlisted-http-vcns [complex type]

Virtual Cloud Networks allowed to access this network endpoint.

This option is a JSON list with items of type VirtualCloudNetwork.
For documentation on VirtualCloudNetwork please see our API reference:
https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/vbinstance/20210601/datatypes/

and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation.
Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work
request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified,
returning on the first state. For example, "--wait-for-state"
SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on whichever
lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code
of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACCEPTED, CANCELED, CANCELING, FAILED, IN_PROGRESS, SUCCEEDED

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the work request
has reached the state defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 30
seconds.
