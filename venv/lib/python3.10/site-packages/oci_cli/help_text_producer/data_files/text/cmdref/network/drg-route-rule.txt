Description
===========

A DRG route rule is a mapping between a destination IP address range
and a DRG attachment. The map is used to route matching packets.
Traffic will be routed across the attachments using Equal-cost multi-
path routing (ECMP) if there are multiple rules with identical
destinations and none of the rules conflict.
