Description
===========

A route distribution establishes how routes get imported into DRG
route tables and exported through the DRG attachments.

A route distribution is a list of statements. Each statement consists
of a set of matches, all of which must be *True* in order for the
statement’s action to take place. Each statement determines which
routes are propagated.

You can assign a route distribution as a route table’s import
distribution. The statements in an import route distribution specify
how how incoming route advertisements through a referenced attachment
or all attachments of a certain type are inserted into the route
table.

You can assign a route distribution as a DRG attachment’s export
distribution unless the attachment has the type VCN. Exporting routes
through a VCN attachment is unsupported. Export route distribution
statements specify how routes in a DRG attachment’s assigned table are
advertised out through the attachment. When a DRG is created, a route
distribution is created with a single ACCEPT statement with match
criteria MATCH_ALL. By default, all DRG attachments (except for those
of type VCN), are assigned this distribution.

   The two auto-generated DRG route tables (one as the default for VCN
   attachments, and the other for all other types of attachments) are
   each assigned an auto generated import route distribution. The
   default VCN table’s import distribution has a single statement with
   match criteria MATCH_ALL to import routes from each DRG attachment
   type. The other table’s import distribution has a statement to
   import routes from attachments with the VCN type.

The route distribution is always in the same compartment as the DRG.
