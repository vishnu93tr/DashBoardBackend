Description
===========

A dynamic routing gateway (DRG) is a virtual router that provides a
path for private network traffic between networks. You use it with
other Networking Service components to create a connection to your on-
premises network using Site-to-Site VPN or a connection that uses
FastConnect. For more information, see Networking Overview.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
