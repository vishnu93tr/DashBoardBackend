Description
===========

Using Vision, you can upload images to detect and classify objects in
them. If you have lots of images, you can process them in batch using
asynchronous CLI endpoints. Visionâ€™s features are thematically split
between Document AI for document-centric images, and Image Analysis
for object and scene-based images. Pretrained models and custom models
are supported.
