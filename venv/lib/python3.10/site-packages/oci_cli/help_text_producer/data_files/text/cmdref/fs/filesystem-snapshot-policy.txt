Description
===========

A file system snapshot policy is used to automate snapshot creation
and deletion. It contains a list of snapshot schedules that define the
frequency of snapshot creation for the associated file systems and the
retention period of snapshots taken on schedule.

For more information, see Snapshot Scheduling.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
