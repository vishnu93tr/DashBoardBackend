model
*****


Description
===========

You can create a custom model by using your dataset to fine-tune an
out-of-the-box text generation base model. Have your dataset ready
before you create a custom model. See Training Data Requirements.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If youâ€™re not authorized, talk to an administrator who gives
OCI resource access to users. See Getting Started with Policies and
Getting Access to Generative AI Resources.
