cross-connect
*************


Description
===========

For use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect. A cross-connect
represents a physical connection between an existing network and
Oracle. Customers who are colocated with Oracle in a FastConnect
location create and use cross-connects. For more information, see
FastConnect Overview.

Oracle recommends you create each cross-connect in a CrossConnectGroup
so you can use link aggregation with the connection.

**Note:** If you’re a provider who is setting up a physical connection
to Oracle so customers can use FastConnect over the connection, be
aware that your connection is modeled the same way as a colocated
customer’s (with *CrossConnect* and *CrossConnectGroup* objects, and
so on).

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
