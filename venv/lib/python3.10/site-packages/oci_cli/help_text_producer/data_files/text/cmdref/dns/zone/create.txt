* Optional Parameters

* Global Parameters

* Example using required parameter


Description
===========

Creates a new zone in the specified compartment.

Private zones must have a zone type of *PRIMARY*. Creating a private
zone at or under *oraclevcn.com* within the default protected view of
a VCN-dedicated resolver is not permitted.


Usage
=====

   oci dns zone create [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment the resource belongs to.

--name [text]

The name of the zone.

Global zone names must be unique across all other zones within the
realm. Private zone names must be unique within their view.

Unicode characters will be converted into punycode, see RFC 3492.

--zone-type [text]

The type of the zone. Must be either *PRIMARY* or *SECONDARY*.

Accepted values are:

   PRIMARY, SECONDARY


Optional Parameters
===================

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags.

   **Example:** *{“Operations”: {“CostCenter”: “42”}}*

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--dnssec-state [text]

The state of DNSSEC on the zone.

For DNSSEC to function, every parent zone in the DNS tree up to the
top-level domain (or an independent trust anchor) must also have
DNSSEC correctly set up. After enabling DNSSEC, you must add a DS
record to the zone’s parent zone containing the *KskDnssecKeyVersion*
data. You can find the DS data in the *dsData* attribute of the
*KskDnssecKeyVersion*. Then, use the *PromoteZoneDnssecKeyVersion*
operation to promote the *KskDnssecKeyVersion*.

New *KskDnssecKeyVersion`s are generated annually, a week before the
existing `KskDnssecKeyVersion*’s expiration. To rollover a
*KskDnssecKeyVersion*, you must replace the parent zone’s DS record
containing the old *KskDnssecKeyVersion* data with the data from the
new *KskDnssecKeyVersion*.

To remove the old DS record without causing service disruption, wait
until the old DS record’s TTL has expired, and the new DS record has
propagated. After the DS replacement has been completed, then the
*PromoteZoneDnssecKeyVersion* operation must be called.

Metrics are emitted in the *oci_dns* namespace daily for each
*KskDnssecKeyVersion* indicating how many days are left until
expiration. We recommend that you set up alarms and notifications for
KskDnssecKeyVersion expiration so that the necessary parent zone
updates can be made and the *PromoteZoneDnssecKeyVersion* operation
can be called.

Enabling DNSSEC results in additional records in DNS responses which
increases their size and can cause higher response latency.

For more information, see DNSSEC.

Accepted values are:

   DISABLED, ENABLED

--external-downstreams [complex type]

External secondary servers for the zone. This field is currently not
supported when *zoneType* is *SECONDARY* or *scope* is *PRIVATE*.

This option is a JSON list with items of type ExternalDownstream.  For
documentation on ExternalDownstream please see our API reference: htt
ps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/dns/20180115/datatypes/ExternalDo
wnstream. This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The
value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as
a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--external-masters [complex type]

External master servers for the zone. *externalMasters* becomes a
required parameter when the *zoneType* value is *SECONDARY*.

This option is a JSON list with items of type ExternalMaster.  For
documentation on ExternalMaster please see our API reference: https:/
/docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/dns/20180115/datatypes/ExternalMaster.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

   **Example:** *{“Department”: “Finance”}*

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--scope [text]

Specifies to operate only on resources that have a matching DNS scope.

Accepted values are:

   GLOBAL, PRIVATE

--view-id [text]

The OCID of the view the resource is associated with.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, CREATING, DELETED, DELETING, FAILED, UPDATING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource has
reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to
30 seconds.
