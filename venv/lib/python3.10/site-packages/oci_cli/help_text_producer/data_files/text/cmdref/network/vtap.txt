Description
===========

A virtual test access point (VTAP) provides a way to mirror all
traffic from a designated source to a selected target in order to
facilitate troubleshooting, security analysis, and data monitoring. A
VTAP is functionally similar to a test access point (TAP) you might
deploy in your on-premises network.

A *`capture filter

contains a set of *`rules <https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaa
s/latest/datatypes/CaptureFilterRuleDetails>`__* governing what
traffic a VTAP mirrors.
