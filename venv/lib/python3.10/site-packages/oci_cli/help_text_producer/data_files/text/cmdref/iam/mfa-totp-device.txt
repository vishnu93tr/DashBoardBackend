mfa-totp-device
***************


Description
===========

Users can enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for their own user
accounts. After MFA is enabled, the user is prompted for a time-based
one-time password (TOTP) to authenticate before they can sign in to
the Console. To enable multi-factor authentication, the user must
register a mobile device with a TOTP authenticator app installed. The
registration process creates the *MfaTotpDevice* object. The
registration process requires interaction with the Console and cannot
be completed programmatically. For more information, see Managing
Multi-Factor Authentication.
