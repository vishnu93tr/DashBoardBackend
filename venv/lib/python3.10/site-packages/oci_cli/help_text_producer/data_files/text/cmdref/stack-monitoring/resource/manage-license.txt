Description
===========

Each resource is assigned a license based on which features are
enabled for it. User is charged differently based on license. Specify
the license type to be updated for the parent resource in the
topology. The license type value is propagated to the member resources
as well. Member resource is a resource which has “contains”
association with the resource.


Usage
=====

   oci stack-monitoring resource manage-license [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--license [text]

License edition of the monitored resource.

Accepted values are:

   ENTERPRISE_EDITION, ENTERPRISE_EDITION_FOR_GPU_INFRASTRUCTURE, STANDARD_EDITION

--resource-id [text]

The OCID of monitored resource.


Optional Parameters
===================

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource. The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource’s
current etag value.
