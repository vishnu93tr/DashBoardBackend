Description
===========

A remote peering connection (RPC) is an object on a DRG that lets the
VCN that is attached to the DRG peer with a VCN in a different region.
*Peering* means that the two VCNs can communicate using private IP
addresses, but without the traffic traversing the internet or routing
through your on-premises network. For more information, see VCN
Peering.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
