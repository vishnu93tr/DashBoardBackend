responder-recipe
****************


Description
===========

A ResponderRecipe resource contains a specific instance of one of the
supported detector types (for example, activity, configuration, or
threat).

A ResponderRecipe resource: * Is effectively a copy of a Responder
resource in which users can make very limited changes if it’s Oracle-
managed, and more changes if it’s user-managed. * Can also be created
by cloning an existing ResponderRecipe resource, either user-managed
or Oracle-managed. * Is visible on Cloud Guard’s Responder Recipes
page. * Is located in a specific OCI compartment. * Can be modified by
users, programmatically or through the UI. * Changes that can be made
here apply globally, to resources in all OCI compartments mapped to a
target that attaches the responder recipe, but are overridden by any
changes made in the corresponding TargetResponderRecipe resource
(effectively created when the responder recipe is attached to the
target).
