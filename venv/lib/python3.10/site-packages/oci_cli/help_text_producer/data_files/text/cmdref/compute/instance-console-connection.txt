instance-console-connection
***************************


Description
===========

The *InstanceConsoleConnection* API provides you with console access
to Compute instances, enabling you to troubleshoot malfunctioning
instances remotely.

For more information about instance console connections, see
Troubleshooting Instances Using Instance Console Connections.

If you are attempting to start a VNC connection to an instance from a
Windows machine without SSH installed, you can consider using plink
instead. The ‘oci compute instance-console-connection get-plink-
connection-string’ command returns a PowerShell command which uses
plink to launch the SSH tunnel necessary to start a VNC connection to
the instance.
