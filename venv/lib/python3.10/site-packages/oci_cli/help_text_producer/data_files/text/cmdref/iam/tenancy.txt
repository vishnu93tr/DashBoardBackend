tenancy

Description
===========

The root compartment that contains all of your organization’s
compartments and other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure cloud resources.
When you sign up for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Oracle creates a
tenancy for your company, which is a secure and isolated partition
where you can create, organize, and administer your cloud resources.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Get Started with Policies.
