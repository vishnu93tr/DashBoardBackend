dynamic-group
*************


Description
===========

A dynamic group defines a matching rule. Every bare metal or virtual
machine instance is deployed with an instance certificate. The
certificate contains metadata about the instance. This includes the
instance OCID and the compartment OCID, along with a few other
optional properties. When an API call is made using this instance
certificate as the authenticator, the certificate can be matched to
one or multiple dynamic groups. The instance can then get access to
the API based on the permissions granted in policies written for the
dynamic groups.

This works like regular user/group membership. But in that case, the
membership is a static relationship, whereas in a dynamic group, the
membership of an instance certificate to a dynamic group is determined
during runtime. For more information, see Managing Dynamic Groups.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
