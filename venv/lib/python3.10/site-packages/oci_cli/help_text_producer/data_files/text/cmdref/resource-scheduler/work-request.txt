Description
===========

This is an asynchronous work request. Work requests help you monitor
long-running operations. When you start a long-running operation, the
service creates a work request. A work request is an activity log that
lets you track each step in the operation’s progress. Each work
request has an OCID that lets you interact with it programmatically
and use it for automation.
